# ✅ 31 — Internal ingest API route (`POST /api/internal/ingest`)

**The gap this closes:** `deferred-features.md` documents the intended
shape of this route in detail but it doesn't exist yet — "Neither use case
is currently implemented."

**Decisions:**

1. **Admin/service-role client, not a per-author session — a deliberate
   change from the original doc.** The original plan had `ingestion_bot`
   authenticate via a stored Supabase session (magic link once, token kept
   in the service's environment) so normal RLS applied. That doesn't scale
   to N placeholder authors — juggling and refreshing N live sessions is
   real operational complexity for no benefit. Using the admin client
   (same pattern as the step-10 cron) removes session management entirely,
   for one bot or a hundred. The route becomes solely responsible for
   correctness (RLS won't double-check ownership), but it's already gated
   by `INGEST_SECRET` as its authorization boundary — same trust model the
   cron already relies on.

2. **Extend the documented `IngestPayload` with an `author` field.** No
   `source` field on the payload itself — with only one forum in scope,
   the route passes the constant `'lejonklou-forum'` to
   `create-placeholder-author.ts` (step 30) itself. Add `source` to the
   payload only if/when a second forum is actually being ingested, not
   speculatively now.
   ```typescript
   type IngestPayload = {
     source_ref: string
     author: {
       forum_username: string
       display_name?: string   // falls back to forum_username if omitted
     }
     track: { artist: string; title: string; album?: string; passage_note?: string }
     snapshot_a: { system_name: string; version_label: string; components?: object[] }
     snapshot_b: { system_name: string; version_label: string; components?: object[] }
     clip_a_url: string
     clip_b_url: string
     before_is_a: boolean
     votes?: Array<{
       voter: {
         forum_username: string
         display_name?: string   // falls back to forum_username if omitted
       }
       chosen_label: 'A' | 'B'
       technique_name: string
       observation?: string
       other_description?: string
     }>
   }
   ```
   Everything else matches the existing documented shape.

3. **Resolved: each vote resolves/creates its own placeholder author —
   votes are not attributed to the post's author.** `votes.user_id` is
   `NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)` with `UNIQUE (test_id, user_id,
   technique_id)` (`audiophile-compare-schema.md`). The post's author and
   the people who commented/voted on that post are frequently different
   forum members; attributing every imported vote to the single post-
   author placeholder would hit the unique constraint the moment two
   different commenters cite the same technique on the same test — a
   routine occurrence, not an edge case. Each `votes[]` entry therefore
   carries its own `voter` (same shape as the top-level `author`), resolved
   via the same `create-placeholder-author.ts` helper from step 30. This
   is the correct extension of decision 1's "per-author placeholder, not a
   single bot" principle to voters, not just system/test owners — a
   payload for one forum post can resolve into a post-author placeholder
   plus N distinct voter placeholders (one per commenter, deduplicated by
   `forum_username` within the payload before resolution).

   **Correction found during implementation:** the plan originally assumed
   calling `create-placeholder-author.ts` twice for the same voter within
   one request was "harmless, just redundant." That's only true
   sequentially. Resolving votes with `Promise.all` over the raw `votes[]`
   array calls it *concurrently* for a repeated `forum_username` (a routine
   case — one commenter citing more than one technique), and its
   resolve-or-create check isn't safe against a concurrent duplicate of
   itself: both calls see no existing `import_authors` mapping, both then
   attempt `auth.admin.createUser()` with the same derived email, and the
   second fails on a real `auth.users` unique-email conflict. Caught by the
   integration test below (its intentional duplicate-voter case failed
   with `"failed to create auth user"` on the first run). Fixed in
   `app/api/internal/ingest/route.ts` by deduplicating voters by
   `forum_username` *before* resolving — each distinct voter is resolved
   exactly once, and every vote entry looks up its already-resolved id
   afterward. Distinct usernames still resolve in parallel safely; only
   the same-key case needed serializing.

4. **System/track matching, scoped correctly for multiple authors.**
   Tracks match globally by artist+title (tracks were never per-owner in
   the schema — no change from the original plan). Systems match by name
   **scoped to the resolved author** — two different forum members can
   both plausibly name a system "Living room rig"; matching must go
   through `systems where owner_id = :placeholder_id and name = :system_name`,
   not a bare name lookup. The original single-bot design didn't need this
   distinction since everything belonged to one owner.

5. **Atomicity — scoped to the DB-only writes.** A single test's worth of
   DB writes (track/system/snapshot resolution, test, clips, clip_mapping,
   votes) should either fully succeed or fully roll back — a partial
   import across six tables would be tedious to find and clean up by hand.
   Recommend a Postgres function (`create or replace function
   ingest_test(...) returns uuid`) called via `.rpc()`, giving
   transactional atomicity for free, over hand-rolled ordered inserts with
   manual cleanup-on-failure in the route handler. Adds one migration;
   worth it for the safety. **Placeholder author resolution (the post
   author, plus now potentially several distinct voters per decision 3)
   happens via step 30's admin-SDK helper *before* calling this RPC** —
   `auth.admin.createUser()` can't run inside a SQL function, so it's
   necessarily outside the atomic boundary, same as it already was for the
   single post-author case. This is self-healing rather than a gap: if the
   RPC fails after N placeholder authors were already created, re-running
   the same payload resolves each one to its existing `import_authors`
   mapping instead of creating duplicates (step 30's idempotency), so no
   cleanup step is needed for a partial failure here.

6. **Idempotency unchanged from the original plan** — check `source_ref`
   on `tests` first; return 200 with an "already imported" indicator
   rather than erroring, so re-running the importer over the same thread
   is always safe.

7. **Clip verification is *not* this route's job.** The route trusts that
   clip health was already confirmed upstream — by step 35's extraction,
   before a candidate was ever marked `ready`/`approved` — not by step 36's
   commit script, which is the one actually calling this route but does no
   validation of its own. Same "client already verified, server persists"
   pattern `POST /api/tests` already uses for browser-submitted clips.
   Re-verifying server-side here would just duplicate step 35's clip-health
   filter for no benefit.

**Files to update:**
- `app/api/internal/ingest/route.ts` (new).
- New migration for the `ingest_test` Postgres function (or equivalent),
  plus step 30's `is_placeholder` column if not already applied.
- `docs/google-oauth.md`-style: no new doc file needed; document the route
  in `api-conventions.md` §5 (Programmatic access) at build time, replacing
  the "not yet implemented" framing there.
- **`docs/vercel-setup.md`** — `INGEST_SECRET` is a new required env var,
  the same category as the `CRON_SECRET` this file already documents
  per-scope (Production/Preview/Development tables). Add an `INGEST_SECRET`
  row to all three, matching the existing `CRON_SECRET` pattern (a strong
  random string per environment; any string for Development).

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** none for the route itself (consistent with every other route),
  but the pure logic around it was factored out into
  `lib/ingestion/ingest-test-payload.ts` (`validateIngestPayload`,
  `resolveTestTitle`) specifically so it could be unit-tested — 16 tests in
  `lib/ingestion/__tests__/ingest-test-payload.test.ts`.
- **Integration:** implemented as a Vitest suite, not a standalone script —
  `app/api/internal/ingest/__tests__/route.integration.test.ts`, run via
  `npm run test:integration` (`vitest.integration.config.ts`, a config
  separate from the main unit suite so `npm test` never touches staging).
  Imports the route's `POST` handler directly and calls it with a
  constructed `NextRequest` against real staging — no browser, no server
  needed. See `testing.md` §11 for the full setup.

  5 tests confirm: (a) the first call creates one test/track/system/
  snapshot set and resolves the placeholder post-author plus two distinct
  voter placeholders, recording both non-duplicate votes; (b) a repeat call
  with the same `source_ref` is a no-op (`alreadyImported: true`, same test
  id); (c) a payload naming an existing system under the *same* author
  reuses it rather than duplicating; (d) two different authors naming the
  same system each get their own system row; (e) the wrong
  `x-ingest-secret` is rejected with 403. The "same voter, same technique,
  twice" case from decision 3 is exercised inside test (a) itself (three
  votes submitted, only two distinct `(voter, technique)` pairs, asserted
  as exactly 2 rows) — confirming `ON CONFLICT (test_id, user_id,
  technique_id) DO NOTHING` inside `ingest_test` silently absorbs the
  duplicate rather than erroring the whole import, so the first vote still
  counts (not quite "hits the constraint as intended" as originally
  planned — a hard error there would roll back the entire test import over
  one duplicate vote, which is worse than silently keeping the first one).

  **Data hygiene:** every synthetic `track`/`system`/`test` title is
  prefixed `[E2E]` and deleted in `afterAll`, in the FK-safe order
  `testing.md` §5 documents — this is a separate Vitest run from
  Playwright, so it cannot rely on `global-teardown.ts` and cleans up after
  itself directly. The four placeholder authors/voters it resolves are
  *not* deleted — fixed usernames, a permanent fixture analogous to
  `E2E_TEST_USER_EMAIL`.

**Files updated:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260707150400_ingest_test_function.sql` — the
  `ingest_test(payload jsonb)` function, plus explicit `REVOKE`/`GRANT` so
  only `service_role` can execute it (see decision 1's security note
  below). Applied to staging only, per the "staging first" topology.
- `lib/ingestion/ingest-test-payload.ts` (new) — `IngestPayload`/
  `IngestVote`/`IngestAuthor` types, `validateIngestPayload`,
  `resolveTestTitle`.
- `app/api/internal/ingest/route.ts` (new).
- `vitest.integration.config.ts` (new); `vitest.config.ts` — added
  `**/*.integration.test.ts` to `exclude`; `package.json` — added
  `test:integration` script.
- `app/api/internal/ingest/__tests__/route.integration.test.ts` (new).
- `docs/vercel-setup.md` — `INGEST_SECRET` added to all three
  environment-scope tables.
- `api-conventions.md` §5 — replaced the "not yet implemented" /
  single-`ingestion_bot` framing with the actual per-author-placeholder,
  admin-client, `ingest_test`-RPC design.
- `audiophile-compare-schema.md` — new "ingest_test function (step 31)"
  section (including the EXECUTE-lockdown security note); corrected the
  stale "Note on ingestion_bot" paragraph to describe per-author
  placeholders instead.
- `core.md` — build status line: step 31 done, 32–33 still planned; test
  counts updated (27 files / 291 unit tests) and a mention of the new
  integration suite.
- `testing.md` — inventory row for `ingest-test-payload.test.ts`; §7
  rewritten from "Future — integration tests" (not yet implemented) to
  describe what now exists; new §11 with the full integration-test setup,
  env vars, data-hygiene approach, and coverage list.

**Verified:**
- `npm run test` — 27 files / 291 tests, all passing (16 new in
  `ingest-test-payload.test.ts`). `npx tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (same
  pre-existing, unrelated `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` failures as every
  prior step).
- **EXECUTE lockdown confirmed directly against staging with the anon
  key:** `POST .../rest/v1/rpc/ingest_test` → `401`,
  `"permission denied for function ingest_test"` — the security-critical
  fix in decision 1's note is real and effective, not just a comment.
- **`npm run test:integration` — 5/5 passing against staging**, after
  fixing the concurrency bug described in decision 3's correction. The
  first run of this same suite genuinely failed on that bug (not a typo in
  the test) — caught and fixed before calling this step done, then
  re-verified: staging left with zero leftover `[E2E]`-prefixed
  track/system/test rows afterward, and the four placeholder fixture
  users persisted as intended (confirmed via direct `import_authors`
  query).

**Addendum (built as part of `build-history/32-import-provenance-ui.md`, now ✅):** step 32
(import provenance UI) added a nullable `tests.source_url` column and
extended `IngestPayload`/`ingest_test`/the route to accept and store it,
via a new migration (`20260707173905_tests_source_url.sql`) layered on top
of `20260707150400_ingest_test_function.sql`, not an edit to that
already-applied file. See `build-history/32-import-provenance-ui.md` for the full detail —
noted here so this section doesn't read as a closed, untouched chapter.
