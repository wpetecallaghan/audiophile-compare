# Audiophile Compare — Build History 

---

## Build steps

### ✅ 1 — Supabase schema, RLS, seed data
Single migration file: `supabase/migrations/20260625094142_initial_schema.sql`.
Includes all tables, RLS policies, auth triggers (`on_auth_user_created`, `on_auth_user_email_updated`),
`test_vote_count` security-definer function, and technique seed data.

### ✅ 2 — Auth — Supabase Auth, middleware, magic link, callback route
`middleware.ts` refreshes session cookies on every request and protects
`/systems`, `/tracks`, `/profile`, `/tests/new`. `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
exchanges the code for a session and handles `?type=recovery` redirects (→ `/profile?reset=true`).

**`app/auth/confirm/route.ts`** (added in step 17) handles the `token_hash` +
`type` verification pattern instead of `code` — needed for any link issued via
the Admin API (`generateLink`), which can't carry a PKCE `code_verifier` since
there's no client-side `signInWithOtp` call to pair one with. Calls
`supabase.auth.verifyOtp({ token_hash, type })` server-side. E2E test auth uses
this route; it's also the correct target for any future admin/service-issued
email link (e.g. an ingestion-bot invite).

### ✅ 3 — Clip URL verification — `POST /api/clips/verify`
`lib/clips/detect-provider.ts` — pure URL classification (no I/O).
`lib/clips/check-url.ts` — HEAD request for `direct` URLs.
`lib/clips/to-clip-data.ts` — converts verified URL into `ClipData` shape.

### ✅ 4 — MediaPlayer — YouTube / Vimeo / native / unknown
A/B coordination via `forwardRef` + `useImperativeHandle`. `ABPlayer` owns both refs and pauses the inactive clip when the other plays. All player components follow the `forwardRef` + `PlayerHandle` contract — see `components.md` §5.

### ✅ 5 — Test creation wizard (`CreateTestForm`)
Multi-step wizard: Track → Snapshots → Clips → Publish.
`systems` is fetched server-side and held in local `useState` so inline creations update the wizard UI without a page reload. Steps do **not** call `router.refresh()`.
- **Inline snapshot creation:** `StepSnapshots` calls `onSnapshotCreated(systemId, snap)`; `CreateTestForm` merges into local state and auto-selects the new snapshot.
- **Inline system creation:** `StepSnapshots` calls `onSystemCreated(system)`; `CreateTestForm` prepends to local state.

Tests: `components/tests/__tests__/StepSnapshots.test.tsx` (28 tests).

### ✅ 6 — Test detail page + blind playback
Server page (`app/tests/[id]/page.tsx`) fetches test data without `clip_mapping`.
`ABPlayer` renders both clips; tally section is hidden until viewer has voted or test is revealed.

### ✅ 7 — Voting
`POST /api/votes` (cast); `PATCH /api/votes/[id]` (update before reveal).
One vote per (user, test, technique) — `UNIQUE` constraint enforced at DB layer.

### ✅ 8 — Results by technique
`TallyDisplay` (server component). `computeTally()` in `lib/votes/compute-tally.ts` groups by technique, computes percentages, detects divergence between curated techniques.
`computeOutcome()` in `lib/votes/compute-outcome.ts` returns win/loss/draw/no-votes/open per snapshot.

### ✅ 9 — System catalogue
Tracks list, track detail, systems list, system detail with win/loss per snapshot, cross-check selector.
- **Inline snapshot on system detail:** `AddSnapshotForm` (client, owner-only) calls `router.refresh()` on success — contrast with wizard which uses local state.
- **Snapshot editing:** `SnapshotSection` (client-with-server-children pattern); `PATCH /api/systems/[id]/snapshots/[snapshotId]`.
- **System create/edit:** `CreateSystemForm` and `EditSystemForm`; pages `/systems/new` and `/systems/[id]/edit`.

### ✅ 10 — URL health check cron
`GET /api/cron/check-urls` — HEAD-checks all `provider='direct'` clips, regardless
of test status (doc corrected in step 27 — this originally said "in open tests," but
the query has never had a test-status filter).
Uses admin (service role) client. Daily at 02:00 UTC via `vercel.json`. Protected by `CRON_SECRET` env var.

### ✅ 11 — Public feed + pagination
`app/page.tsx` — server component, public. `?page=N`; `PAGE_SIZE=20`; `.range()` + `count: 'exact'`.
`FeedCard` server component. Normalises Supabase array/object join ambiguity before passing typed props.

### ✅ 12 — Site header
`SiteHeader` (server, in layout); `SignOutButton` (client: `supabase.auth.signOut()` → `window.location.href = '/'`).
Unauthenticated: wordmark + "Sign in". Authenticated: Tests / Systems / Tracks / Profile + Sign out.

### ✅ 13 — Display name / profile
Trigger derives `display_name` from email local-part on sign-up (coalesces OAuth `raw_user_meta_data` name fields first).
`PATCH /api/profile` updates `display_name` (RLS: own row only). `ProfileForm` client component; `app/profile/page.tsx` server page.

### ✅ 14 — OAuth / Google sign-in
`supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`. `OAuthButtons` client component renders above magic link form on `/login`; both accept and thread the `redirectTo` prop.
Auth trigger updated to: `coalesce(raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', raw_user_meta_data->>'name', split_part(email,'@',1))` so OAuth sign-ups get a real display name automatically.
`app/auth/callback/route.ts` unchanged — `exchangeCodeForSession` handles OAuth code exchange identically to magic links.
Setup instructions: `docs/google-oauth.md`.

### ✅ 15 — Centralised string resources (i18n)
All user-facing strings in `messages/en.json`, namespaced by feature area.
Package: `next-intl` (App Router native; "without routing" mode — no URL locale prefix).
`app/layout.tsx` wraps tree with `<NextIntlClientProvider messages={messages}>`.
`next.config.mjs` wraps config with `createNextIntlPlugin()`.
`types/next-intl.d.ts` extends `IntlMessages` from `en.json` — unknown keys are TypeScript errors.
`vitest.setup.ts` mocks both `next-intl` and `next-intl/server` with async factories returning actual English values for human-readable test assertions.
E2E tests import `messages/en.json` directly so copy changes keep tests in sync automatically.
**Namespaces:** `common`, `nav`, `auth`, `systems`, `snapshots`, `tests`, `profile`, `feed`, `tracks`, `crosscheck`.

### ✅ 16 — Email/password auth and account management
Register with email + name + password; sign in with password (alongside magic link and Google); change email, password, or display name from the profile page; forgot password flow.

**Supabase configuration (both projects):** Authentication → Providers → Email: confirm "Confirm email" is on; "Disable new user signups" must be off; `/auth/callback` in allowed Redirect URLs.

**Schema:** `handle_user_email_updated()` trigger is part of `20260625094142_initial_schema.sql` — no separate migration.

**`auth/callback` — recovery flow:**
```typescript
const type = searchParams.get('type')
if (code) {
  await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)
}
if (type === 'recovery') {
  return NextResponse.redirect(`${origin}/profile?reset=true`)
}
return NextResponse.redirect(`${origin}${redirectTo}`)
```
The profile page detects `?reset=true` and auto-opens `ChangePasswordForm`.

**Forgot password:** `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo: '…/auth/callback?type=recovery' })`

**Register:** `supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password, options: { data: { full_name: name }, emailRedirectTo: '…/auth/callback' } })`

**Password sign-in:** `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })` → `window.location.href = redirectTo ?? '/'`

**Login page:** Three tabs — Password | Magic link | Google. Links to `/register` and forgot-password flow.

**Profile page additions:** `ChangeEmailForm` (`updateUser({ email })`), `ChangePasswordForm` (`updateUser({ password })`).

### ✅ 17 — End-to-end test coverage
Full Playwright suite passes against staging (24/24). Fixed along the way:
env vars not loading in `playwright.config.ts`, Vercel SSO Deployment
Protection blocking the automated browser (see `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`
in `testing.md` §9), admin-issued magic links needing `token_hash` verification
via the new `app/auth/confirm/route.ts` instead of the `code` flow, and several
spec files with selectors that had drifted from the current UI.

Not covered by any spec (optional future additions, not blocking this step):
cross-check selector flow, feed vote-count display.
See `testing.md` for current coverage and `docs/end-to-end-testing.md` for test strategy.

### ✅ 18 — Deployed version / commit info page
`/version` shows the deployed commit SHA and message, restricted to a fixed
admin allowlist.

**Data source:** Vercel auto-injects `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`,
`VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE`, `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF` (branch), and `VERCEL_ENV`
as environment variables at build **and** runtime — no config needed, just
read `process.env` server-side. Unset in local dev — falls back to
`t('unavailable')` per field rather than erroring.

**Access control — email allowlist, no schema change:**
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var — comma-separated, case-insensitive. Parsed and
  checked by `lib/admin/is-admin-email.ts` (`isAdminEmail()`), unit-tested in
  `lib/admin/__tests__/is-admin-email.test.ts` (7 cases: unset var, null/undefined
  email, match, no match, case-insensitivity, whitespace, empty entries).
  Named `lib/admin/` deliberately distinct from `lib/supabase/admin.ts` — the
  latter is the service-role DB client; this is a privileged-*user* check.
- `supabase.auth.getUser()` then `isAdminEmail(user.email)` — same shape as
  the ownership checks in `api-conventions.md §2`, just against a fixed list
  instead of a DB row.
- `/version` added to `middleware.ts`'s protected paths so an unauthenticated
  visitor is redirected to `/login` first (consistent with `/systems`,
  `/tracks`, `/profile`, `/tests/new`).
- The page calls `notFound()` for an authenticated user who isn't on the
  allowlist — matches the existing `notFound()` pattern in
  `app/systems/[id]/page.tsx` — rather than a "logged in but not allowed"
  message that would confirm the route's purpose to anyone who finds it.

**Files:** `app/version/page.tsx` (server component, no client JS),
`lib/admin/is-admin-email.ts`. i18n: new `version` namespace in `en.json`.

**Verified manually** (dev server, real magic-link sign-in via
`app/auth/confirm/route.ts`): unauthenticated → 307 to `/login`; authenticated
+ allowlisted → renders commit fields (all "unavailable" locally, as
expected); authenticated + not allowlisted → 404, not a redirect.

**Rejected alternative:** a shared-secret env var (`VERSION_SECRET`, matching
the `CRON_SECRET`/`INGEST_SECRET` pattern used for non-user-facing routes) —
simpler, but gates on "knows the secret" rather than "is a specific
privileged person," which is a weaker fit for a page a human visits in a
browser.

### ✅ 19 — About / how-it-works page
`/about` explains, in plain English, why the service exists and how to use
it. **Public** — the opposite access model from step 18's `/version`: this
page is aimed partly at signed-out visitors deciding whether to register, so
it must not require auth and must not go in `middleware.ts`'s protected paths.

**Route:** `app/about/page.tsx` — server component, fully static content, no
`'use client'` needed (no interactivity, no per-user data). `notFound()`/auth
checks from step 18 do **not** apply here.

**Content structure** (plain-English rewrite of `docs/audiophile-compare-app-specification.md`
§1 "Core value propositions" and §4 "User stories" — not a copy of that
document's technical language):
1. **Why this exists** — blind A/B testing removes the placebo/expectation
   bias that makes it hard to tell whether a hi-fi change (cable, component,
   position, room treatment) actually changed the sound, versus you just
   expecting it to.
2. **How it works, for listeners** — browse the public feed, play clip A and
   clip B without knowing which is "before" and which is "after," vote by
   listening technique, see results once you've voted or the creator reveals.
3. **How it works, for creators** — describe a system as a snapshot, record
   before/after clips, publish a test, invite people to listen and vote,
   reveal when ready.
4. Anonymous visitors can browse and read; **listening to clips and voting
   require an account** — link to `/login`/`/register` here.

**i18n:** new `about` namespace in `messages/en.json`. Long-form paragraph
content still goes through translation keys, per the existing "never
hardcode strings in components" rule — one key per paragraph/section rather
than one key per short label, since this page is prose rather than UI chrome.

**Nav link:** `SiteHeader.tsx` currently renders the wordmark, then branches
on `user` — systems/tracks/profile/sign-out when signed in, "Sign in" link
when not. The `/about` link must render in **both** branches (it's for
everyone), so it goes outside that branch, next to the wordmark. New
`nav.about` message key for the label.

**Optional nice-to-have, not required for this step:** a CTA at the bottom of
the page that links to `/register` for signed-out visitors or `/tests/new`
for signed-in ones — skip unless it turns out to be trivial once the static
content is in place.

**Testing:** added to `public-feed.spec.ts` (unauthenticated project) — asserts
`/about` renders without a redirect to `/login`, the inverse of step 18's
redirect assertion. No unit test — no branching logic to cover.

**Verified manually** (dev server): unauthenticated `/about` → 200, no
redirect; nav shows wordmark + About in both auth states (confirmed via a
real magic-link sign-in for the authenticated case); `auth.spec.ts`'s nav
assertions still pass unaffected. Full E2E: `public-feed.spec.ts` (8/8) and
`auth.spec.ts` (2/2) both green against the live dev server; full unit suite
still 25 files / 256 tests.

### ✅ 20 — Visual polish
Denser, more consistent, higher-contrast, modern look. No layout or feature
changes — purely presentation. Grounded in an audit of actual class usage,
not guesswork. Full design system reference now lives in `components.md §12`
— read that before touching any styling. Summary of what changed:

- **Type:** h2 section headings had three competing variants (`text-lg`,
  `text-base`, `text-base sm:text-lg`) — standardized on
  `text-base sm:text-lg font-semibold` everywhere. h1/body/metadata sizes
  were already consistent.
- **Color:** collapsed text-gray sprawl (7+ shades) to two roles — muted
  (`gray-500 dark:gray-400`) and a separate higher-contrast "readable body
  copy" tier (`gray-600 dark:gray-300`, e.g. `/about`'s prose — kept
  deliberately, not a bug). Fixed `gray-400` used unpaired in light mode
  (borderline-failing contrast on white, 73 occurrences). Collapsed borders
  to two roles (`gray-200/700` default, `gray-100/800` subtle). Unified all
  status badges to `outcomeLabel()`'s exact pairing (amber alone had 9
  different shades in use before). Fixed one component using `yellow-*`
  instead of the established `amber-*` warning color, and one blue "primary"
  button where every other primary action uses black.
- **Density:** page container padding `py-6 sm:py-10` → `py-4 sm:py-6`
  everywhere (11 files) plus one page on a divergent `py-12` pattern.
  Reduced `space-y-8`/`space-y-10` section gaps to `space-y-6`.
- **Buttons:** standardized to two roles × two size tiers (primary/secondary
  × standard/compact) — see `components.md §12`. Converted ~15 bare
  `<a>`/`<Link>`/`<button>` inline actions (edit, cancel, back, add-snapshot,
  add-component) to the bordered secondary style; left real page-navigation
  links (breadcrumbs, pagination, register/login CTAs) and the header's
  "Sign out" (grouped with nav links, not a form action) unstyled.

**Dark-mode contrast bug found via manual screenshot verification** (not
caught by code review or typecheck): every primary `bg-black` button was
invisible against the `#0a0a0a` dark-mode page background (`app/globals.css`).
Fixed by pairing every `bg-black`/`text-white` with `dark:bg-white
dark:text-black` (inverting on dark mode) — the same pattern already used in
`CreateTestForm.tsx`'s step indicator, now applied consistently everywhere.
This is why the plan explicitly calls for a real rendered check, not just a
class-name audit — screenshots in both color schemes caught something the
whole rest of this pass would have shipped broken.

**Verified:** full unit suite (25 files / 256 tests) and full E2E suite
(25/25) both green against a live dev server; manual Playwright screenshots
of home, about, login, systems list, and system detail pages in both light
and dark mode.

**Follow-up — componentized the pattern (post-step-20):** the manual class
consolidation above still meant hand-editing the same button/badge class
string in 15+ files — exactly the kind of drift that caused this step in the
first place. Added `components/ui/Button.tsx` and `Badge.tsx`
(`class-variance-authority` + `clsx`, see `docs/dependencies.md`) holding
each pairing in one place, then migrated every remaining raw `bg-black`
button and status-badge `<span>` across the app to them (`outcomeLabel()` in
`app/systems/[id]/page.tsx` now returns a `status` key instead of a `cls`
string). See `components.md §12` for usage. One-off single-use styles (the
amber confirm/trigger buttons in `RevealButton.tsx`) were deliberately left
as raw classes rather than forcing them into a variant used exactly once.
Also fixed a few unpaired dark-mode colors turned up along the way (green
success-message text, a stray `border` missing its light-mode shade). Full
unit suite, full E2E suite, and light/dark screenshots verified again after
migration — all green, pixel-identical to before.

### ✅ 21 — Link component
Same motivation as the step-20 follow-up: `<Link>`/`<a>` styling was
hand-copied class strings, which is exactly the pattern that let the step-20
bugs propagate. Grounded in an audit of real usage across `app/` and
`components/` (excluding `components/ui/`), same process as the Button/Badge
audit.

**Audit findings (grep on exact className strings, one `<a>`/`<Link>` role
already covered by `buttonVariants()` excluded — e.g. `ProfileForm.tsx`,
`EditSystemForm.tsx`, the systems detail "Edit" link):**

- **Nav link** — `text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400
  hover:text-gray-900 dark:hover:text-gray-100` (+ `shrink-0` on 4 of 5) —
  **5 occurrences, all in `SiteHeader.tsx`** (About, Systems, Tracks,
  Profile, Sign in).
- **Card link** — `rounded border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700
  px-3 sm:px-4 py-3 hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-800
  transition-colors`, prefixed with either `block` (`app/systems/page.tsx`,
  `FeedCard.tsx`) or `flex items-center justify-between`
  (`app/tracks/page.tsx`, `app/tracks/[id]/page.tsx`, the test list in
  `app/systems/[id]/page.tsx`) depending on whether the Link itself is the
  flex container or wraps one — **5 occurrences**, shared part identical.
- **Breadcrumb link** — bare `hover:underline`, no color/size classes of its
  own (relies on ambient text color) — **6 occurrences**: `tracks/[id]`,
  `register`, `systems/[id]/edit` (×2), `systems/[id]`, `LoginTabs.tsx`. One
  utility class is likely too trivial to justify a component — same call as
  leaving `RevealButton.tsx`'s one-off amber buttons raw.
- **Inline CTA link** — `text-blue-600`, plus size/hover variants that
  disagreed with each other: `text-sm text-blue-600 hover:underline` (5:
  `page.tsx` pagination ×2, `about/page.tsx` ×2), `text-blue-600 underline`
  with no `hover:` (5: `page.tsx`, `tracks/page.tsx`, `systems/page.tsx`
  empty-state CTAs, plus `tests/[id]/page.tsx`'s "sign in to listen" — which
  was also the one instance of this role on a plain `<a href="/login">`
  instead of `next/link`'s `Link`, losing client-side navigation), and
  `text-xs text-blue-600 hover:underline` (1: `CrossCheckSelector.tsx`,
  itself another plain `<a>` instead of `Link`). Unlike the deliberate
  `gray-500/400` vs `gray-600/300` two-tier split kept in step 20, this
  3-way split had no matching semantic distinction — same CTA role,
  inconsistent `hover:` treatment — so it read as drift, not design. Fixed
  by standardizing on `text-sm text-blue-600 hover:underline`, fixing both
  stray `<a>`s to `Link`, and treating the one `text-xs` instance as a
  `size="compact"` variant prop rather than a raw `className` override —
  `cn()`/`clsx` doesn't dedupe conflicting Tailwind utilities the way
  `tailwind-merge` would, so appending `className="text-xs"` on top of a
  variant that already sets `text-sm` would not reliably win.
  `ChangePasswordForm.tsx`'s `text-sm text-blue-600 hover:underline` looked
  like a fifth instance of this role from a className grep alone, but it's a
  `<button type="button">` disclosure toggle, not a link — left alone,
  same call as the amber `RevealButton.tsx` buttons in step 20.

**Shape built:** one `components/ui/Link.tsx`, mirroring `Button.tsx`'s
structure — a `cva` config with a `variant` prop (`nav | card | inline`) and
a `size` prop (`standard | compact`, scoped to `inline` only via
`compoundVariants`) on top of `next/link`'s `Link`, not a plain `<a>`.
`card`'s shared border/hover classes live in the variant; the `block` vs
`flex items-center justify-between` split stays a per-call-site `className`
override (real layout difference, not a styling inconsistency to force into
one shape). `variant="breadcrumb"` was deliberately **not** built — a single
utility class repeated 6 times doesn't clear the bar that justified
`Button`/`Badge` (15+ files, multi-class strings, a real dark-mode bug from
copy-paste drift) — those 6 `hover:underline` breadcrumb links were left as
plain `next/link` `Link`s.

The empty-state CTAs' always-on `underline` was folded into `inline`
(now `hover:underline` like the majority) rather than kept as a distinct
"prominent" sub-variant — same drift as the size/hover split, not a
deliberate design choice.

**Verified:** full unit suite (25 files / 256 tests) and full E2E suite
(25/25) both green; `tsc --noEmit` shows no new errors (pre-existing,
unrelated vitest-mock typing errors in `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` are
untouched by this change); manual Playwright screenshots of home, about,
systems, tracks, track detail, and test detail pages in both light and dark
mode, authenticated and unauthenticated.

### ✅ 22 — Componentize remaining repeated form/text elements
Same motivation and process as steps 20/21: `Button`, `Badge`, and `Link`
only covered three element types. An audit of every other DOM element
styled more than once (`grep` on exact className strings across `app/` and
`components/`, excluding `components/ui/`) turned up five more repeated
roles, all now componentized, plus two one-off bugs fixed mechanically.

**1. `components/ui/Heading.tsx`** — `<Heading level={1|2}>`, a `cva` with
`level` as the only variant. Replaced 12 `<h1>`s and 13 `<h2>`s. One `<h2>`
look-alike (`ChangePasswordForm.tsx`'s `text-sm font-semibold` disclosure
heading) uses a genuinely different, smaller size and was correctly left
raw rather than forced into `level={2}`.

**2. `components/ui/FieldLabel.tsx`** — `tone: 'standard' | 'muted'`.
`standard` (`text-sm font-medium mb-1`) replaced 15 near-identical labels.
`muted` (`text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-1`) unified three
disagreeing variants found across `CrossCheckSelector.tsx` (was `text-xs
font-medium text-gray-500...`, no `mb-1`), `VoteForm.tsx` (matched exactly),
and — found only once actual migration started, not in the original audit
— `SnapshotSection.tsx`'s label/notes fields (was `text-xs font-medium
text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 block mb-1`, a third color). All three
converged on one canonical muted style.

**3. `components/ui/TextField.tsx`** — exports `fieldVariants` (`cva`,
`size: 'standard' | 'compact'`) plus three thin wrappers, `TextInput`,
`TextArea`, `Select`, all consuming it — same relationship `Button.tsx` has
to `buttonVariants`. `standard` replaced 18 occurrences; `compact` unified
the two disagreeing tiers found in the audit (`VoteForm.tsx`'s
`ring-blue-400`/`text-sm` vs `SnapshotSection.tsx`'s `ring-blue-500`/
`text-xs`) onto one pairing — `ring-blue-500` (matches `standard`'s ring
color) and `text-xs` (matches `Button`'s own size convention, where
`compact` means smaller text). The 12-occurrence bug variant (missing
`border-gray-200` + no focus ring) was folded into `standard`, gaining a
visible focus ring and a proper light-mode border where neither existed
before. **Real gotcha hit during the build**: `<input>`/`<select>` both
have a *native* HTML `size` attribute (numeric — character width / visible
option count) that collides with a `cva` variant prop of the same name;
`TextInputProps`/`SelectProps` explicitly `Omit<..., 'size'>` from the DOM
props before intersecting with the variant props to avoid a silent type
error. `TextArea` has no such native `size`, so needed no workaround.

**4. `components/ui/FormMessage.tsx`** — `tone: 'error' | 'success'`,
fixed `text-sm` always (real usage split `text-sm`/`text-xs` 7-vs-12
with no semantic reason). Replaced 19 error + 4 success occurrences,
including fixing `StepClips.tsx`'s stray `green-700` (now `green-600`,
matching every other success message).

**5. `components/ui/Callout.tsx`** — `tone: 'warning' | 'success' | 'info' |
'neutral'`. Replaced 6 alert/info boxes (`RevealButton.tsx`,
`TallyDisplay.tsx`, `UnknownPlayer.tsx` — warning; `StepTrack.tsx` —
success; `MappingBadge.tsx` — info; `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx`'s sign-in
gate — neutral). Padding/text-size overrides passed via `className` where
an instance genuinely differs (`TallyDisplay.tsx`'s tighter `px-3 py-2.5`).
**Fixed `MappingBadge.tsx`'s dark-mode bug**: `bg-blue-50 border-blue-200`
had no `dark:` classes at all — the box itself now inherits dark variants
from `Callout`'s `info` tone, and the inner text colors (`text-blue-900`,
`text-blue-700`) were given matching `dark:text-blue-100`/
`dark:text-blue-300` pairs that were also missing before.

**Two bugs found during the original audit, fixed mechanically —
no new component involved:**
- `VoteForm.tsx`'s submit button (`rounded bg-blue-600 ...`) had been missed
  by the step-20 Button/Badge migration — the same "blue primary instead of
  black" bug that migration fixed everywhere else. Now a plain `<Button>`.
- `SignOutButton.tsx`'s raw `<button>` classes were character-for-character
  `linkVariants({ variant: 'nav' })` from step 21, hand-copied because
  signing out isn't page navigation so it can't be a `<Link>`. Now consumes
  `linkVariants({ variant: 'nav' })` directly via `cn()`, the same way
  `Link.tsx` itself consumes `buttonVariants`-adjacent patterns.

**Deliberately left as one-offs, not componentized** (single occurrence
each, or a genuinely unique interaction, same bar as `RevealButton.tsx`'s
amber buttons in step 20): `LoginTabs.tsx`'s tab bar (conditional
active/inactive classes, the only tab UI in the app) and its "forgot
password" toggle button; `StepTrack.tsx`'s track-search-result row button;
`SnapshotSection.tsx`'s inline "×" remove-component button;
`ChangePasswordForm.tsx`'s disclosure toggle (a `<button>`, not a link,
despite matching `text-sm text-blue-600 hover:underline` — already the
canonical inline-link style by coincidence, so no change needed).

**Verified:** full unit suite (25 files / 256 tests) and full E2E suite
(25/25) both green — the E2E suite exercises nearly every migrated form
(test-creation wizard, voting, systems CRUD, profile); `tsc --noEmit` shows
no new errors; manual Playwright screenshots of register, login, profile,
and the test-creation wizard's track step (including its success `Callout`
and "add track" `FieldLabel`/`TextInput` form) in both light and dark mode,
authenticated and unauthenticated.

### ✅ 23 — Allow anonymous clip playback
**The gap this closes:** `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx:159-169` is the *only*
gate on playback:
```tsx
{/* Player — login required to see */}
<div className="w-full max-w-full min-w-0">
  {user ? (
    <ABPlayer clipA={clipA} clipB={clipB} />
  ) : (
    <Callout tone="neutral" ...>
      <Link href="/login">{t('signIn')}</Link>{' '}{t('signInToListen')}
    </Callout>
  )}
</div>
```
No middleware involvement (`/tests/[id]` isn't in `middleware.ts`'s
protected-paths list) and no RLS gate (`clips`/`tests` SELECT policies are
`using (true)`) — this single conditional is 100% of the enforcement.
Confirmed separate from the blind/reveal mechanism: `clip_mapping`
visibility (`isCreator || isRevealed`, lines 43-55) and vote-tally
visibility (`canSeeTally`, line 70) are independent gates and do not
change.

**Decisions:**

1. **Playback — remove the gate entirely.** Replace the `user ? ... : ...`
   branch with an unconditional `<ABPlayer clipA={clipA} clipB={clipB} />`.
   No new prop threading needed — `clipA`/`clipB` are already computed
   unconditionally above this block (lines 104-105).

2. **Voting — stays gated, but give anonymous visitors an explicit prompt
   where the vote form used to be invisible.** Today, `{user && !isRevealed
   && <VoteForm .../>}` (line 182) simply renders nothing for a logged-out
   visitor — that was fine when the sign-in callout above it already
   covered "you need an account for any of this." Once playback no longer
   implies that, add a sibling anonymous-only prompt:
   ```tsx
   {!user && !isRevealed && (
     <Callout tone="neutral" className="p-4 sm:p-6 text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
       <Link href="/login">{t('signIn')}</Link>{' '}{t('signInToVote')}
     </Callout>
   )}
   ```
   placed where `VoteForm` would render. Revealed tests show nothing extra
   for anonymous visitors (voting is already closed for everyone at that
   point, same as today).

3. **Copy — repurpose, don't duplicate.** Rename `messages/en.json`'s
   `tests.signInToListen` (`"to listen to the clips."`) to
   `tests.signInToVote` (`"to vote."`), reusing the existing `tests.signIn`
   ("Sign in") key for both the old and new callout. Confirmed only two
   references to `signInToListen` in the whole repo: `messages/en.json` and
   `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` — no other call sites to update.

**Files updated:**
- `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` — the two changes above.
- `messages/en.json` — key rename.
- `api-conventions.md` Rule 3 (currently: *"clip playback requires
  login... Enforced in middleware for protected routes. API routes serving
  clip data must also check that `user` is not null."*) — rewrite to state
  playback is public and only voting requires auth; this existing rule text
  was already slightly aspirational (no middleware or API-route check for
  clip data actually exists today), so the rewrite also corrects that
  inaccuracy.
- `core.md`'s Public paths parenthetical `(login required for play/vote)` →
  `(login required to vote)`.
- `docs/audiophile-compare-app-specification.md` — the visitor-persona
  bullet ("Cannot play clips or vote without registering" → "Can play
  clips; cannot vote without registering") and the page-structure row for
  test detail (`Public (play requires login)` → `Public (voting requires
  login)`).
- `testing.md` §6 coverage table — `public-feed.spec.ts` row gains the new
  anonymous-playback assertion.

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** none added — `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` is a server component
  with no client-side branching logic to unit test, consistent with the
  existing convention (this page has never had a unit test; it's covered
  end-to-end only).
- **E2E (`e2e/tests/public-feed.spec.ts`, the unauthenticated Playwright
  project):** added a new `Anonymous clip playback` describe block using
  the same `seedCompleteTest` helper `voting.spec.ts` already uses from
  `e2e/helpers/admin.ts`. Covers: an anonymous visitor to a seeded test's
  detail page sees the `ABPlayer` (asserted via the `Clip A`/`Clip B`
  headings it renders); the same page shows the new "Sign in to vote"
  callout (`m.tests.signInToVote`) — scoped to `getByRole('main')` since
  the header nav also has its own "Sign in" link.
- **E2E (`e2e/tests/voting.spec.ts`, authenticated project):** unchanged —
  confirmed it doesn't implicitly depend on the removed branch.

**Verified:** `npm run test` — unit suite unchanged at 25 files / 256 tests,
all passing. `npx tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (32 pre-existing failures
in `__tests__/supabase-client.test.ts`/`supabase-server.test.ts`, unrelated
Supabase-mock typing issues, confirmed present before this step's changes
via `git stash`). `npm run test:e2e` — full suite 27/27 passing (25
pre-existing + 2 new), both the unauthenticated and authenticated projects,
run against a local dev server (`.env.local`'s `E2E_BASE_URL` points at the
staging deployment by default, which doesn't have this branch's code yet —
overrode it to `http://localhost:3000` for this run). Confirms the player
renders for a logged-out visitor and the "Sign in to vote" prompt appears
in place of the vote form on an open test.

### ✅ 24 — Add `/privacy` and `/terms` pages
Built per plan, no deviations. `app/privacy/page.tsx` and `app/terms/page.tsx`
— server components, public, static content, mirroring `app/about/page.tsx`
exactly; neither added to `middleware.ts`'s `protectedPaths`. New `privacy`,
`terms`, and `footer` namespaces in `messages/en.json` (one key per
section heading/paragraph, `about`'s convention).

New `components/SiteFooter.tsx` (Privacy/Terms links, `variant="nav"` on
`Link`) rendered in `app/layout.tsx` below `{children}` — kept deliberately
minimal (no About link, no copyright line) since `SiteHeader.tsx`'s nav
already carries About in both auth states.

Content uses the four details confirmed by the user (`wpete.callaghan@gmail.com`,
England and Wales, minimum age 16, individual operator — "I", not "we",
no company name/address) and is grounded in what the app's code actually
does: Supabase + Vercel + Google (OAuth only) as the only third parties, no
analytics/tracking dependencies, clip URLs are user-supplied links to
externally hosted media rather than anything hosted by the app, and the
`comments` schema table is correctly omitted since no UI reads or writes it
yet. Cross-references step 26 (no self-service account deletion exists yet;
requests go through the contact email) and step 27 (clip links can go dead
— covered by "no warranty").

**Tests:** `e2e/tests/public-feed.spec.ts` — three new assertions in the
unauthenticated describe block: `/privacy` and `/terms` each render (200, no
redirect to `/login`), plus a footer-links-visible check on `/`. No unit
tests — same reasoning as `/about` (static server components, no branching
logic).

**Verified:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean for all new/changed files (pre-existing
unrelated errors in `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` untouched — confirmed
present before this change). `npm run test` — unchanged at 25 files / 256
tests. **Not verified as rendered**: this sandbox has no `.env.local` with
Supabase credentials, so `npm run dev` 500s on every route including
pre-existing ones (confirmed `/about` 500s too, from `middleware.ts` needing
a live Supabase client on every request) — not something introduced by this
step, but a real gap in this step's own verification. Run the dev server or
E2E suite somewhere with Supabase env vars configured (or push to staging)
before relying on this as confirmed-working.

**Still open, not done as part of this step:**
- `docs/google-oauth.md` Option A — these pages are the prerequisite, but
  submitting for Google's brand verification (logo upload, Authorized
  domain via Search Console, publishing the OAuth consent screen) is a
  dashboard action outside this repo, not covered here.

### ✅ 25 — Fixed header/footer app shell with internal scroll region
Built per plan, no deviations. `app/layout.tsx`'s `<body>` is now
`h-dvh flex flex-col overflow-hidden`; `{children}` is wrapped in a new
`flex-1 overflow-y-auto` div between `SiteHeader` and `SiteFooter`, which
each gained `shrink-0`. `app/login/page.tsx` and `app/register/page.tsx`
changed their `<main>` from `min-h-screen` to `h-full` so they fill the new
scrollable region instead of forcing it to a full extra viewport height.
No other page needed changes — everything else has no explicit height and
flows into the new wrapper exactly as it did into the document body before.

**Verified** (dev server, real Supabase-backed render — not just `tsc`):
`npx tsc --noEmit` clean for all changed files; `npm run test` unchanged at
25 files/256 tests (pure layout/CSS, no branching logic, as expected). Five
throwaway Playwright assertions (not added to the permanent suite — pure
layout checks with no user-facing behavior to regress-test long-term):
header/footer bounding-box position identical before and after scrolling a
long page at a short (1000×500) viewport; `document.scrollingElement`
never moved and `body.scrollHeight` never exceeded the viewport (confirms
a single scrollbar, not two); `/about`'s footer bottom edge lands exactly
at the viewport bottom on a short page (900px viewport, ~500px of content —
true sticky-footer behavior, not a gap); `/login` and `/register` still
vertically center their form within the header-to-footer region after the
`h-full` change; no horizontal-scroll regression at a 375px mobile width.
Also screenshotted (light + dark, plus a 390×700 mobile viewport): header
and footer both stay pinned on screen while the card list scrolls
underneath, `/login` centers correctly in dark mode with good contrast, and
the mobile view shows the same fixed-chrome behavior. All passed on the
first attempt — no fixes needed.

### ✅ 26 — Delete tests, snapshots, and systems
User-requested rules: a creator can delete a **test** they created, but
only if it has **zero votes recorded** — listening is a real time
commitment, so once a vote exists it must be respected and the test is
frozen forever (no delete, presumably no further edits either, though
nothing about tests is currently editable post-creation anyway). A creator
can delete a **snapshot** they created only if it has no undeleted tests
referencing it (as `snapshot_a_id` or `snapshot_b_id`). A creator can
delete a **system** they created only if it has no undeleted snapshots.
Built per plan below, plus two things the plan missed — see "Deviations
from the plan" at the end.

**Decision: hard delete (real `DELETE`), relying on the existing foreign
keys' default `RESTRICT` behavior for the cascade ordering — not soft
delete.**

This reverses an earlier pass at this plan (see git history / prior version
of this section), which landed on soft delete via a `deleted_at` column.
That reasoning was entirely about protecting *other users'* votes from a
unilateral delete by the test creator. The vote rule above makes that
protection categorical and unconditional instead: a test with any vote can
never be deleted, full stop — so a test that *is* eligible for deletion is,
by definition, one where nothing but the creator's own `clips`/
`clip_mapping` rows are at stake. Hard-deleting it destroys no one else's
data.

That protection propagates upward for free, by referential integrity, not
just convention: a snapshot can only be deleted once every test that used
it is gone — meaning every one of those tests was either always vote-free
and already deleted, or never existed. Either way, no vote was ever
attached to that snapshot, so hard-deleting it is equally safe. Same logic
covers systems one level up. **No `deleted_at` column, no RLS read-policy
changes, and no new "is this really gone" bookkeeping anywhere** — a plain
`DELETE` plus the database's own existing `REFERENCES` constraints (default
`NO ACTION`, which behaves like `RESTRICT`) already refuse to remove a
snapshot/system while a child row still exists. The one already-decided
piece that carries over unchanged: no restore/undo UI, since a hard delete
has no "undo" to build in the first place.

**Clips are not shared rows — confirmed against the actual cross-check
code, not just the schema doc.** `clips.test_id` is `NOT NULL REFERENCES
tests(id)`; every test, including cross-check tests, gets its own brand-new
pair of `clips` rows. `app/api/tests/cross-check/route.ts` copies the
`source_url`/`provider`/`media_type` *string values* from an existing clip
into fresh rows scoped to the new test — it never re-links an existing
`clips.id`. `lib/clips/find-shared-clips.ts`'s "shared" refers to sharing
the same underlying **track** (recording) across two systems' tests, not a
shared clip row. So there is no scenario where deleting a test's clips
could orphan a clip still used by another test, and no clip-deduplication
work is in scope for this step — each clip already belongs to exactly one
test.

**Schema migration needed — not for the tests/snapshots/systems FKs
themselves (already correctly restrictive by default with no migration
required), but for `clips` and `clip_mapping`, which need `ON DELETE
CASCADE` added to their `test_id` foreign key.** Unlike votes, `clips` and
`clip_mapping` rows are wholly owned by the test — created together with
it, never independently meaningful — so cascading their deletion is correct
and safe, not a repeat of the votes problem:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.clips
  DROP CONSTRAINT clips_test_id_fkey,
  ADD CONSTRAINT clips_test_id_fkey
    FOREIGN KEY (test_id) REFERENCES public.tests(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE public.clip_mapping
  DROP CONSTRAINT clip_mapping_test_id_fkey,
  ADD CONSTRAINT clip_mapping_test_id_fkey
    FOREIGN KEY (test_id) REFERENCES public.tests(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```
(Constraint names confirmed exactly as written via a direct `pg_constraint`
query against staging before writing the migration — no `\d` guessing
needed.)
`votes.test_id` deliberately keeps its default (non-cascading) foreign key
as a **second, database-enforced layer of protection**: even if the
app-layer "zero votes" check had a bug, the database itself would still
refuse to delete a test that a vote row references.

**New/updated API routes** (mirroring the existing `PATCH` handlers'
auth/ownership pattern — 401 unauthenticated, 404 on any ownership
mismatch to avoid leaking existence):
- `DELETE /api/tests/[id]` (new) — creator only; 409 if `votes` has any row
  for this `test_id`; else deletes the test (cascading to its own `clips`/
  `clip_mapping`).
- `DELETE /api/systems/[id]/snapshots/[snapshotId]` (new handler on the
  existing route file) — system-owner only; app-layer pre-check returns 409
  if any test still has this snapshot as `snapshot_a_id`/`snapshot_b_id`
  (giving a friendly error), backed by the DB's own FK `RESTRICT` as a
  second layer; else deletes the snapshot.
- `DELETE /api/systems/[id]` (new handler on the existing route file) —
  owner only; same pattern — 409 if any snapshot still references this
  system, else delete.

**Reads need no changes** — a deleted row is simply gone, so the home feed,
track detail's test list, systems list/detail, and both snapshot pickers
(`CrossCheckSelector.tsx`, `steps/StepSnapshots.tsx`) all keep working
exactly as they do today with no new filter to add or forget.

**UI:** a "Delete" action on the test detail page (creator only, hidden
once `voteCount > 0` — the page already computes this for the existing
vote-count display), the snapshot list in `SnapshotSection.tsx` (owner
only, hidden once any test references it), and the system detail page
(owner only, hidden once any snapshot exists) — all proactively hidden, not
just left to fail on submit, since each page already has the relevant
child count in hand (`app/systems/[id]/page.tsx` already fetches every
snapshot's tests to render the existing lists; `system_snapshots.length`
gives the system's own count for free).

The plan said to reuse `RevealButton.tsx`'s two-step confirm pattern —
that held, but the pattern itself moved. With three new call sites
(`DeleteTestButton.tsx`, `SnapshotSection.tsx`, `DeleteSystemButton.tsx`)
needing the exact same confirm/cancel interaction as `RevealButton.tsx`,
copy-pasting a fourth ~25-line block was worse than extracting it once it
actually repeated — see `components/ui/ConfirmButton.tsx` and
`components.md`'s new entry for it. `RevealButton.tsx` itself was
refactored to use it too, so there's now exactly one implementation of
this interaction, not four.

**Deviations from the plan (found during implementation, not anticipated
by it):**

1. **The plan said "no RLS policy changes" but meant read policies only —
   there were no DELETE policies at all.** `tests`, `clips`, and
   `clip_mapping` only had select/insert/update RLS policies; `system_snapshots`
   only had select/insert/update too (`systems` was the only one of the
   five with a blanket `for all` policy already covering delete). Without a
   delete policy, RLS silently blocks both a direct `DELETE` and — this is
   the sharper trap — the `ON DELETE CASCADE` this step's other migration
   depends on, since a cascaded delete is still subject to RLS for the
   acting role. Fixed with a second migration
   (`20260707074919_delete_rls_policies.sql`) adding `tests: creator
   delete`, `clips: test creator delete`, `clip_mapping: test creator
   delete`, and `snapshots: owner delete`. Also documented as
   `api-conventions.md` Rule 5 (extended) and Rule 6 (new).
2. **Staging's migration history had already drifted before this step
   started** — a function (`public.test_vote_counts`, a bulk variant of
   `test_vote_count` for the feed page) existed on staging but was never
   committed as a migration file, so `supabase db push` refused to run
   until reconciled: `supabase migration repair --status reverted
   20260630163029` (bookkeeping only, does not touch schema) to clear the
   phantom remote entry. Adopting that drift into a local migration file
   via `supabase db pull` was attempted but needs Docker for its shadow
   database, unavailable in this environment — left as a follow-up, not
   blocking this step.

**Migrations applied to staging only** (`audiophile-staging`), not
production, per the documented "staging first" deployment topology:
`20260707074426_cascade_delete_clips_and_mapping.sql` and
`20260707074919_delete_rls_policies.sql`.

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** no new file — extended the existing
  `components/systems/__tests__/SnapshotSection.test.tsx` (20 → 27 tests)
  with a `Delete` describe block: shown for owner with zero referencing
  tests, hidden with a referencing test, hidden for non-owner, confirm/cancel
  step, successful `DELETE` + `router.refresh()`, server-error handling.
  `DeleteTestButton.tsx`/`DeleteSystemButton.tsx`/`ConfirmButton.tsx` have no
  dedicated unit tests, consistent with `RevealButton.tsx`'s existing
  precedent (e2e-only) and the rest of `components/ui/*` (no primitive there
  has its own unit test file either).
- **E2E:** new `e2e/tests/delete.spec.ts` (authenticated project), 6 tests —
  creator deletes a zero-vote test (redirects to `/`); Delete hidden once a
  vote exists; owner deletes an unreferenced snapshot; Delete hidden when a
  test references the snapshot; owner deletes a snapshot-less system
  (redirects to `/systems`); Delete hidden when the system has a snapshot.

**Verified:** `npm run test` — 25 files / 263 tests, all passing (up from
256; the 7 new are in `SnapshotSection.test.tsx`). `npx tsc --noEmit` — no
new errors (same 32 pre-existing, unrelated `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts`
mock-typing failures as every prior step). `npm run test:e2e` — full suite
36/36 passing (30 pre-existing + 6 new), run against a local dev server
(`E2E_BASE_URL` overridden to `http://localhost:3000` — `.env.local`'s
default points at staging, which doesn't have this branch's code yet).
Confirmed via the teardown counts, not just UI assertions, that the
"successful delete" tests actually removed rows rather than merely hiding
them client-side. Migrations verified applied on staging via a direct
`pg_constraint`/`pg_policies` query (`confdeltype = 'c'` on both FKs, all
four new delete policies present) before any app-layer testing began.

### ✅ 27 — Handle verified-broken clip URLs
**The gap this closed:** the URL health-check cron (step 10) already wrote
`url_status` (`ok`/`degraded`/`dead`) to `clips` daily, but nothing
downstream ever read it — a dead end, not a feature. `lib/clips/
to-clip-data.ts` fetched `url_status` off the raw row and dropped it before
building the `ClipData` the player receives; `NativePlayer.tsx` had no
concept of it. Before this step, a dead clip just failed silently in the
`<audio>`/`<video>` element with zero explanation, and the creator had no
way to find out short of noticing it themselves.

**Known limitation, documented not solved here:** detection is inherently
partial. The cron only HEAD-checks `provider='direct'` clips — YouTube/
Vimeo embeds return 200 regardless of whether the specific video still
exists (see the comment in `app/api/cron/check-urls/route.ts`), so a
removed YouTube video is invisible to this system. The UI here must not
imply "not flagged broken" means "definitely works" — it doesn't claim
that anywhere. Embed-specific liveness checking (e.g. oEmbed lookups) is
out of scope for this step.

**Also found while investigating, fixed as a one-liner:** step 10's
description above said the cron checks clips "in open tests" — the actual
query has no test-status filter at all; it checks every `provider='direct'`
clip regardless of test status. Doc inaccuracy, not a behavior change —
corrected in that step's own entry above.

**Decisions:**

1. **Visibility — all three surfaces, not just one:**
   - Listener-facing: on the test detail page, a `Callout tone="warning"`
     in place of/alongside the player for a `dead` clip (e.g. "Clip A is
     currently unreachable"). Safe to say which *label* (A/B) is broken
     without leaking `clip_mapping` before/after identity, since
     `url_status` lives on the raw clip row, independent of the mapping.
     `degraded` gets a lighter-touch note; the player still renders (may be
     transient — a 5xx or timeout, not necessarily gone for good).
   - Creator-facing: no dedicated "my tests" page exists today, so the
     natural creator-scoped surfaces are the test detail page itself
     (already `isCreator`-aware) and `app/systems/[id]/page.tsx`, which
     already lists the creator's own tests per snapshot with outcome
     badges — the new badge in the next point covers this for free, no new
     page needed.
   - Public feed/list badges: a new `Badge` `status` variant, `broken`,
     added to `components/ui/Badge.tsx`'s existing union (`win | loss |
     draw | blind | revealed | broken`). `FeedCard.tsx` (home feed,
     `app/page.tsx`) and `app/tracks/[id]/page.tsx`'s test list don't fetch
     `clips` at all yet and need it added; `app/systems/[id]/page.tsx`'s
     per-snapshot test list already embeds `clips(id, label)` (pre-dates
     this step) so it only needs `url_status` added to that existing
     embed. All three need it to compute "has a dead clip" per row.

2. **Vote gating — blocks only on `dead`, not `degraded`:** the test detail
   page computes `hasDeadClip` from the already-fetched clip rows and
   passes it to `VoteForm`, which hides the form and shows an explanatory
   message instead of the normal vote controls when true. Server-side,
   `POST /api/votes` re-checks clip status before accepting and returns 409
   if a chosen clip is dead — defense in depth against a direct API call
   bypassing the UI gate, same pattern as step 26's DB-level backstop on
   vote-blocked test deletion. `degraded` alone never blocks voting — it
   may be transient (a 5xx or a timeout), and blocking on it would punish
   listeners for a possibly-temporary failure.

   **Correction (step 26 shipped after this plan was written, and added a
   second anonymous-only block this rule also needs to cover):**
   `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` now also renders a "Sign in to vote" `Callout`
   for logged-out visitors (`!user && !isRevealed`) — telling them to sign
   in implies voting is possible once they do, which isn't true on a
   `dead` test. That block should also be suppressed when `hasDeadClip` is
   true; the player-area warning from point 1 already explains why, so no
   second message is needed for anonymous visitors — just hide the prompt
   rather than replace it.

3. **Remediation — creator can replace a dead clip's URL, but only if the
   test has zero votes, mirroring step 26's "once voted, frozen forever"
   principle exactly.** Replacing a clip's URL changes what's being
   compared; on a voted test that risks retroactively misrepresenting what
   earlier listeners actually heard, the same integrity concern that
   blocks deleting a voted test. New route (`PATCH /api/clips/[id]` or
   similar — no clip mutation route exists today, only `POST /api/clips/
   verify` for validation at creation time) — creator-only, own test only,
   409 if the test has any vote. Reuses the existing verify-then-persist
   flow already built for test creation (`app/api/clips/verify/route.ts`,
   and `StepClips.tsx`'s `ClipInput` UI pattern — URL input + Verify button
   + inline verified/dead message — is a natural fit to extract and reuse
   as an inline "Replace URL" action on the test detail page). If the test
   has votes, no replace action is shown at all — just the permanent
   warning from point 1.

   **Correction:** step 26 (built after this plan was written) already put
   a "Creator controls" row on the test detail page holding `RevealButton`
   and `DeleteTestButton` side by side. "Replace URL" joins that same row
   as a third creator-only action, gated the same way `DeleteTestButton`
   already is (`voteCount === 0`) — no new layout slot needed.

**Resolved at build time:** the cron does **not** skip re-checking clips on
tests that are already `dead` and have votes. It would need a join from
`clips` through `tests` to `votes` just to skip work that's already cheap
(a HEAD request per `direct` clip, once a day) — added complexity for a
marginal efficiency gain, not a correctness requirement the plan actually
needed. Left as a future optimization if the clips table ever grows large
enough for it to matter, not built now.

**Deviations from the plan (found during implementation, not anticipated
by it):**

**`clips` was missing its UPDATE RLS policy on the live database —
present in the initial schema migration file, absent from `pg_policies`
when actually queried.** Cause unknown, predates this step: nothing before
step 27 ever ran `UPDATE` on `clips` (verify doesn't touch the DB, test
creation only `INSERT`s), so the gap was silent until `PATCH
/api/clips/[id]` became the first caller to need it. Without the policy,
Postgres silently updates zero rows on an RLS-blocked `UPDATE` — no error,
so the route returned `200 { ok: true }` while nothing actually changed.
Caught by an end-to-end e2e failure (the page still showed the dead-clip
warning after "successfully" replacing the URL), traced by comparing a
direct authenticated `curl` PATCH against the DB row afterward. Fixed two
ways: recreated the policy
(`20260707093703_restore_clips_update_policy.sql`, applied to staging
only), and hardened the route itself — it now chains `.select().single()`
after the update and treats a missing row as failure, so this class of bug
can't silently recur. See `api-conventions.md` Rule 5's second real-world
instance of this exact failure mode.

**Files updated:**
- `components/ui/Badge.tsx` — `broken` status variant.
- `components/clips/ClipInput.tsx` (new) — extracted from `StepClips.tsx`.
- `components/tests/steps/StepClips.tsx` — now imports the extracted
  `ClipInput`.
- `components/tests/VoteForm.tsx` — `hasDeadClip` prop, blocked-message
  early return.
- `components/tests/ReplaceClipUrlButton.tsx` (new).
- `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` — `hasDeadClip` computation, per-label
  dead/degraded warnings, anonymous vote-prompt suppression, `VoteForm`
  wiring, `ReplaceClipUrlButton`(s) in the creator-controls row.
- `app/api/clips/[id]/route.ts` (new) — `PATCH`, replace a clip's URL.
- `app/api/votes/route.ts` — dead-clip 409 check.
- `app/page.tsx` + `components/feed/FeedCard.tsx`,
  `app/tracks/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/systems/[id]/page.tsx` — `url_status`
  added to each's clips query; `broken` badge takes priority over the
  normal status wherever each computes one.
- `messages/en.json` — `tests.clipHealth.*`, `tests.vote.blockedByDeadClip`,
  `tests.replaceClip.*`, `feed.statusBroken`, `tracks.statusBroken`.
- `supabase/migrations/20260707093703_restore_clips_update_policy.sql`
  (applied to staging only, per the "staging first" deployment topology).

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** extended `VoteForm.test.tsx` (20 → 22) for `hasDeadClip`
  (renders normally by default; shows the blocked message and hides the
  form/radios when true). No new tests for `ReplaceClipUrlButton.tsx` or
  `ClipInput.tsx` — consistent with the existing precedent that this class
  of component (`RevealButton`/`DeleteTestButton`/`DeleteSystemButton`,
  and every `components/ui/*` primitive) is e2e-covered, not unit-tested.
- **E2E:** new `e2e/tests/clip-health.spec.ts` (4 tests) — dead-clip
  warning shown and player still renders; vote form replaced with the
  blocked message; creator replaces the dead clip's URL and the warning
  clears; "Broken" badge shown on both the track and system detail pages.
  Extended `e2e/helpers/admin.ts`'s `seedClip`/`seedCompleteTest` with an
  optional `url_status`/`clipAStatus`/`clipBStatus` override (default
  `'ok'`, backward compatible with every existing caller).

**Verified:** `npm run test` — 25 files / 265 tests, all passing.
`npx tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (same pre-existing, unrelated
`__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` failures as every prior step). `npm run
test:e2e` — full suite 40/40 passing (36 pre-existing + 4 new), run
against a local dev server (`E2E_BASE_URL` overridden to
`http://localhost:3000`, same reason as steps 23/26 — staging doesn't have
this branch's code). Confirmed via a direct authenticated `curl` PATCH
plus a follow-up `pg_constraint`/`pg_policies`/row query — not just the
passing e2e test — that the clip actually changes in the database, not
just in the UI. Also spot-checked the feed's "Broken" badge directly via
`curl` against the rendered HTML (public page, no auth needed).

### ✅ 28 — Concise presentation for unsupported-playback clips

**The gap this closed:** `MediaPlayer.tsx` falls back to `UnknownPlayer.tsx`
whenever a clip can't be embedded — either `provider === 'unknown'` (URL
didn't parse) or `provider === 'direct' && media_type === 'unknown'` (a
direct-looking URL whose HEAD response wasn't recognizable audio/video,
e.g. a page link rather than a raw media file). Before this step,
`UnknownPlayer` rendered an amber `Callout` box with "This URL could not be
identified as a supported media source." plus a separate "Open link
directly" link — in *both* the blind and revealed views, taking real
estate that duplicated what the revealed view's blue `MappingBadge` box
already showed once before/after was known.

**Decisions:**

1. **Blind view — strip `UnknownPlayer.tsx` down to a bare link.** Drop the
   `Callout` wrapper and the "could not be identified" message entirely;
   render just the link (kept as `target="_blank" rel="noopener
   noreferrer"`, matching today's external-link handling). The "Clip
   A"/"Clip B" heading above it (rendered by `ABPlayer.tsx`, unchanged)
   already identifies which clip it is, so nothing else is needed.
   `UnknownPlayer`'s existing copy is hardcoded (a pre-existing gap from
   before step 15's i18n rule) — since this is a genuine rewrite of the
   component's content, not a passive reuse like step 27's `ClipInput`
   extraction, add it properly to `messages/en.json` this time instead of
   carrying the gap forward: new top-level `tests.openClipLink: "Open link
   directly"` key.

2. **Shared predicate for "this clip can't be embedded," used by both the
   player and the page** — new `lib/clips/is-unsupported.ts`:
   ```ts
   export function isUnsupportedClip(clip: { provider: string; media_type: string }): boolean {
     return clip.provider === 'unknown' || (clip.provider === 'direct' && clip.media_type === 'unknown')
   }
   ```
   `MediaPlayer.tsx`'s own dispatch chain already encodes this exact
   condition via its cascading `if`s falling through to `<UnknownPlayer>`
   — left as-is, no behavior change needed there. The new helper exists so
   `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` (which needs the identical boolean for the
   two decisions below) can't silently drift out of sync with
   `MediaPlayer`'s own fallback condition.

3. **Revealed view — `MappingBadge.tsx`'s "Before"/"After" become links
   for unsupported clips only; `ABPlayer.tsx` stops rendering that clip's
   slot.** Two new optional props on `MappingBadge`:
   `clipAUnsupportedUrl: string | null` / `clipBUnsupportedUrl: string |
   null` (the clip's `source_url` when `isUnsupportedClip()` is true for
   it, else `null`). When set, the corresponding "Before"/"After" span
   becomes an `<a href={...} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` —
   when `null`, unchanged plain text (a clip with a working embedded
   player doesn't need a redundant link, per your confirmation). Computed
   in `page.tsx` from the already-selected `rawA`/`rawB.provider`/
   `media_type` (no query change needed — both columns are already
   fetched) and passed alongside the existing `clipAId`/`beforeClipId`/
   `afterClipId` props.

   `ABPlayer.tsx` gains two new optional props, `hideClipA?: boolean` /
   `hideClipB?: boolean` (default `false`) — when true, that slot (heading
   + `MediaPlayer`) doesn't render at all, refs/`onPlay` coordination
   untouched (a hidden slot's ref is simply never attached; the sibling's
   pause-the-other-clip call safely no-ops). `ABPlayer` stays exactly as
   unaware of reveal state as it is today — it just receives `true`/`false`
   for a slot it's told not to render, the same architectural boundary
   `isCreator`/`isRevealed` already respect elsewhere (all decided
   server-side in `page.tsx`, never inside a player component). Page.tsx
   passes `hideClipA={isRevealed && !!mapping && isUnsupportedClip(rawA)}`
   (and the `B` equivalent) — gated on `mapping` being non-null too, not
   just `isRevealed`, so a hidden slot is never left with nothing to show
   in the (unexpected) case the mapping fetch itself failed — that must
   match exactly the same condition `MappingBadge` itself is already
   rendered under (`{isRevealed && mapping && <MappingBadge .../>}`).

**Files updated:**
- `components/media/players/UnknownPlayer.tsx` — stripped to a bare link.
- `lib/clips/is-unsupported.ts` (new) — shared predicate.
- `components/tests/MappingBadge.tsx` — two new optional URL props;
  conditional link rendering per clip.
- `components/media/ABPlayer.tsx` — `hideClipA`/`hideClipB` optional props.
- `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` — computes `hideClipA`/`hideClipB` once; passes
  the new props to both `MappingBadge` and `ABPlayer`.
- `messages/en.json` — new `tests.openClipLink` key.

**Deviation from the plan (found while writing the e2e test, not
anticipated by it):** `e2e/helpers/admin.ts`'s `seedCompleteTest` never
created a `clip_mapping` row — meaning `MappingBadge` had never actually
been exercised by any e2e test before this step. (`voting.spec.ts`'s
existing reveal test tolerated this via `.or(page.getByText(m.tests.
mapping.before))`, matching either outcome rather than asserting mapping
specifically.) Fixed by adding a `seedClipMapping` helper and calling it
from `seedCompleteTest` (clip A = before, clip B = after) — this is a
fixture realism fix for every caller, not just this step's own tests, and
doesn't change `voting.spec.ts`'s existing behavior since its check
already tolerated either branch.

**Files updated (test infrastructure):**
- `e2e/helpers/admin.ts` — `seedClip` gained optional `provider`/
  `mediaType` params (defaulting to the existing hardcoded `'youtube'`/
  `'video'`, backward compatible); `seedCompleteTest`'s `opts` gained
  `clipAProvider`/`clipAMediaType`/`clipBProvider`/`clipBMediaType`,
  mirroring step 27's `clipAStatus`/`clipBStatus`; new `seedClipMapping`
  helper, called from `seedCompleteTest`; `SeededClip` now includes
  `source_url` (needed so e2e assertions can check a link's `href` against
  the actual seeded URL).

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** extended `components/media/__tests__/ABPlayer.test.tsx`
  (1 → 3 tests) — `hideClipA`/`hideClipB` each hide that slot's heading
  and player entirely, leaving the other slot unaffected. No new unit test
  files for `MappingBadge.tsx` or `UnknownPlayer.tsx` — consistent with
  the existing precedent that this class of small presentational
  component (`FeedCard`, `RevealButton`, `DeleteTestButton`,
  `ConfirmButton`, `ClipInput`) is e2e-covered, not unit-tested.
- **E2E:** two new cases in `e2e/tests/clip-health.spec.ts` (same file as
  step 27's dead-clip tests — same "clip surfaces something about itself
  outside the player" family of behavior), seeding a test with clip A
  `provider: 'direct', media_type: 'unknown'`: blind view shows the bare
  link (asserted against the seeded clip's actual `source_url`) with no
  "could not be identified" text anywhere on the page; after the creator
  reveals, Clip A's slot in the player is gone entirely, and exactly one
  link to the clip's URL exists on the page (the mapping badge's Before/
  After label) rather than two.

**Verified:** `npm run test` — 25 files / 267 tests, all passing.
`npx tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (same pre-existing, unrelated
`__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` failures as every prior step). `npm run
test:e2e` — full suite 42/42 passing (40 pre-existing + 2 new), run
against a local dev server (`E2E_BASE_URL` overridden to
`http://localhost:3000`, same reason as every prior step touching e2e).
Confirmed `voting.spec.ts`'s reveal test still passes unchanged after
`seedCompleteTest` started seeding a real `clip_mapping` row.

### ✅ 29 — Register with Google

**The gap this closed:** `/login` has offered "Continue with Google" since
step 14 (tabbed alongside password/magic-link since step 16), but
`/register` (`RegisterForm.tsx`) only ever offered email/password —
there's no way to reach `signInWithOAuth` from the register page today.

**No backend or Supabase/Google config changes needed — confirmed, not
assumed:** `app/auth/callback/route.ts` treats every OAuth code exchange
identically regardless of which page initiated it (no `login` vs
`register` branch, none needed). `handle_new_user()` (the trigger that
creates a `public.users` row) fires `after insert on auth.users for each
row` — unconditional on auth method — so a first-time Google sign-in
already creates the account correctly whether a user clicks the button on
`/login` or a future `/register`. `docs/google-oauth.md` already states
this plainly (its existing "already works for OAuth" framing was written
about `/login`, but the same Google Cloud OAuth client and the single
shared `/auth/callback` redirect URI cover both pages — no new redirect
URI, no new consent-screen scope, nothing to touch in the Google Cloud
Console or the Supabase dashboard). This step is a pure frontend addition:
render the existing, already-generic `OAuthButtons` component
(`components/OAuthButtons.tsx` — takes only an optional `redirectTo` prop,
already has zero knowledge of login vs register) on the register page too.

**Decisions:**

1. **Divider, not a second tab bar.** `LoginTabs.tsx` uses tabs because
   login genuinely has three parallel, equally-weighted methods a
   returning user might reach for (password / magic link / Google).
   Register has one primary path (fill the form) and one one-click
   alternate (Google) — a top-of-page divider ("or register with email")
   above the existing form fits that shape better than tabs, and avoids a
   decision the codebase doesn't need to make yet: `components.md`
   currently describes `LoginTabs.tsx`'s tab bar as deliberately
   uncomponentized because it's "the only tab UI in the app" (step 22).
   Adding a *second*, differently-shaped tab bar (two tabs, no forgot-
   password sub-state) would force that call now, for no UX benefit over
   a plain divider. `app/register/page.tsx` renders `<OAuthButtons />`
   above `<RegisterForm />`, separated by that divider — mirroring where
   `OAuthButtons` originally sat on `/login` *before* step 16 introduced
   tabs there (step 14: "above magic link form").

2. **Reuse `auth.googleButton` ("Continue with Google") as-is — don't add
   a register-specific variant.** `OAuthButtons.tsx` hardcodes
   `t('googleButton')` internally; a register-specific string would mean
   either parameterizing the component (unnecessary complexity for
   different-in-tone-only copy) or forking it. Google's own OAuth button
   branding guidance recommends the same "Continue with Google" wording
   regardless of sign-in vs sign-up context, so reusing the existing key
   isn't just simpler, it's the more correct choice.

3. **No `redirectTo` support added to `/register`.** `/login` threads a
   `redirectTo` query param because middleware redirects unauthenticated
   visitors *to* `/login?redirectTo=...` from a protected route. Nothing
   redirects to `/register` with an intended destination today, and
   `RegisterForm`'s own email/password path doesn't redirect anywhere
   post-submit either (it shows `registrationSuccess` in place, since
   email confirmation is required first). `<OAuthButtons />` on
   `/register` is rendered with no `redirectTo` prop, defaulting to `/` —
   consistent with there being no existing destination to preserve.

4. **Known, expected asymmetry — not a bug, worth a one-line note in the
   UI or docs so it isn't "discovered" later as a defect:** registering
   via Google is instant (no email-confirmation step, since Google already
   verified the address), while email/password registration requires
   confirming via a sent link. Both are correct for their method; nothing
   to reconcile.

**Files updated:**
- `app/register/page.tsx` — renders `<OAuthButtons />` above
  `<RegisterForm />`, with a plain divider between them (two flex-1
  `border-t` rules flanking the label — deliberately not the absolute-
  positioned "line behind centered text on a matching background" pattern,
  which would need to match the page's actual background color exactly;
  getting that pairing wrong is the same bug class `components.md` step 20
  already flagged once for `Button`'s dark-mode background).
- `messages/en.json` — new `auth.orRegisterWithEmail: "or register with
  email"` key; no other new copy (button text reused per decision 2).
- `docs/google-oauth.md` — reworded the opening line and added a paragraph
  after the `handle_new_user` explanation stating plainly that register
  reuses the exact same OAuth client and callback route, so a future
  reader doesn't assume a second Google Cloud/Supabase setup is needed.

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** none needed, as planned — `OAuthButtons.tsx` and
  `RegisterForm.tsx` are both reused/left completely unchanged; their
  existing unit tests needed no changes and still pass.
- **E2E:** new case in `e2e/tests/public-feed.spec.ts` — `/register` shows
  both the Google button and the email form's fields at once (no tabs).
  Same scope limit as the existing login-page Google test: only confirms
  the button renders, doesn't attempt a real OAuth round trip.

**Verified:** `npm run test` — 25 files / 267 tests, unchanged and all
passing (this step touched no unit-tested code). `npx tsc --noEmit` — no
new errors (same pre-existing, unrelated `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts`
failures as every prior step). `npm run test:e2e` — full suite 43/43
passing (42 pre-existing + 1 new), run against a local dev server
(`E2E_BASE_URL` overridden to `http://localhost:3000`, same reason as
every prior step touching e2e).

### ✅ 30 — Forum ingestion: placeholder author infrastructure

New `public.users.is_placeholder` column (no RLS policy needed — only ever
set via the admin client) plus a new `public.import_authors` table
(`source`, `external_username`, `user_id`, publicly readable — resolved in
favor of an explicit table over a derived-email lookup, since slugification
is lossy/collision-order-dependent) backing `lib/ingestion/
create-placeholder-author.ts`, a resolve-or-create helper that gives each
distinct Lejonklou forum author their own real, full `auth.users`/
`public.users` identity (email `<slug>@import.audiophile-compare.uk`) — a
deliberate pivot from `deferred-features.md`'s original
single-`ingestion_bot`-owns-everything plan, so a later merge step can hand
real people their own imported content by repointing
`import_authors.user_id`, not discarding it. Migration applied to staging
only, not yet production. Full plan and verification detail:
`build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 31 — Forum ingestion: internal ingest API route

Built the `POST /api/internal/ingest` route and its atomic
`ingest_test(payload jsonb)` Postgres function (track/system/snapshot/
test/clips/clip_mapping/votes in one transaction), extended with per-author
system matching and each vote resolving its own voter placeholder (not the
post author) — a gap found during planning review, since two different
commenters citing the same technique would otherwise collide on `votes`'
unique constraint. Uses the admin/service-role client throughout (removes
the session-management problem the original session-based bot-auth design
would have hit once there are many placeholder authors instead of one).
`ingest_test` is `security definer`, so its migration explicitly revokes
EXECUTE from `anon`/`authenticated` and grants it to `service_role` only —
otherwise anyone with the anon key could call it directly over PostgREST,
bypassing both RLS and the route's `INGEST_SECRET` check. First integration
test in this project (`npm run test:integration`, hits real staging).
Migration applied to staging only, not yet production; `INGEST_SECRET` is
set in Vercel for Development/Preview/Production. Full plan and
verification detail: `build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 32 — Import provenance UI

**The gap this closes:** step 30 made `import_authors` publicly readable
specifically so the UI could show forum provenance — "may also help a real
forum member recognize their own imported content" — but no page actually
surfaces it. Must ship **before** the ingestion pipeline (steps 33–38)
actually runs, so imported content is never live without it. Unlike steps
30–31/33–38, this is UI work, not ingestion-pipeline infrastructure, so it
gets its full detail directly here rather than in
`build-history-ingestion.md`.

**Decisions:**

1. **Reuse existing bylines; add one new one.** Three pages already render
   `by {creator?.display_name ?? t('anonymous')}` —
   `components/feed/FeedCard.tsx`, `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx`, and the
   per-test rows in `app/tracks/[id]/page.tsx`. Extend each of their
   existing `creator:users!creator_id(display_name)` queries to also
   select `is_placeholder`. `app/systems/[id]/page.tsx` currently shows no
   owner/creator information at all, to anyone — add one there for the
   first time, but scoped to only appear when the owner is a placeholder,
   so ordinary systems stay visually unchanged. This is provenance for
   imported content, not a general "add public attribution everywhere"
   change.

2. **A new `Badge` status variant, not a new component.** `components/
   ui/Badge.tsx` already has `win`/`loss`/`draw`/`blind`/`revealed`/
   `broken` — add `imported` alongside them rather than inventing a
   bespoke component for one badge.

3. **Store and link to the real forum post — this reopens already-shipped
   step 31.** New nullable column `tests.source_url text` (null for every
   web-UI-created test; populated only for imported ones). `IngestPayload`
   (`lib/ingestion/ingest-test-payload.ts`) gains an optional
   `source_url?: string`; `app/api/internal/ingest/route.ts` passes it
   through to the `ingest_test` RPC call; `ingest_test` itself needs a
   **new** migration (not an edit to the already-applied
   `20260707150400_ingest_test_function.sql`) that adds the column and
   `create or replace function public.ingest_test(...)` with the extended
   body — same signature, so `create or replace` is safe, no drop
   required. Same "new migration layers on an already-applied one"
   pattern already used for `20260707074426_cascade_delete_clips_and_
   mapping.sql` and others. Worth being explicit about: this step's value
   (a working troubleshooting link once the pipeline is live) is judged
   worth reopening shipped code for, rather than deferring the link to a
   later, separate change.

4. **The link only ever appears alongside the badge**, not as a
   standalone general-purpose link on every test — it's contextual to "this
   was imported." Uses the existing `Link` component (`variant="inline"`)
   with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`; `Link` already wraps
   `next/link`, which renders a plain anchor for an absolute URL, so no new
   link-handling code is needed.

5. **Copy lives in the `common` i18n namespace** (currently just
   `cancel`/`networkError`) — shared across the systems/tests/tracks/feed
   namespaces, so it doesn't belong to just one of them. New keys: the
   badge label and the link text (e.g. "View original post").

6. **Forward-compatible with the not-yet-planned claim step, for free.**
   `is_placeholder` flips to `false` once a future claim reassigns
   ownership and deletes the placeholder row — the badge and link
   disappear automatically; no extra logic needed here or in that later
   step.

7. **The scraper/extraction steps (33/34) need to actually populate
   `source_url`.** Step 33 (scraper) already plans to capture each post's
   real `post_url`; step 35 (extraction) needs to carry the *specific
   pair's* post URL into the candidate's `source_url` field. This is a
   plan update to `build-history-ingestion.md`, not new code, since those
   steps aren't built yet.

8. **Addendum (from step 39's design): a contact link next to the badge,
   so provenance actually leads somewhere.** Something like "Think this is
   yours? [contact email]" alongside the "View original post" link —
   otherwise this step shows *who* imported content belongs to with no way
   for that person to act on it. A static mailto/contact string, not a new
   form or claim-request flow — step 39 (`build-history-ingestion.md`)
   handles verification and the actual merge from there.

**Files updated:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260707173905_tests_source_url.sql` (new) —
  `alter table public.tests add column source_url text;` plus
  `create or replace function public.ingest_test(...)` extended to store
  `payload->>'source_url'`, re-affirming the EXECUTE lockdown from step 31.
  Layered on top of the already-applied `20260707150400_...` migration, not
  an edit to it. Applied to staging only, not yet production.
- `lib/ingestion/ingest-test-payload.ts` — `IngestPayload.source_url?:
  string`.
- `app/api/internal/ingest/route.ts` — passes `source_url` through to the
  RPC payload.
- `lib/ingestion/__tests__/ingest-test-payload.test.ts` — new case
  covering the optional field.
- `app/api/internal/ingest/__tests__/route.integration.test.ts` — extended
  to assert `source_url` round-trips onto the created `tests` row.
- `components/ui/Badge.tsx` — new `imported` (purple) status variant.
- `messages/en.json` — new `common` namespace keys: `importedBadge`,
  `viewOriginalPost`, `claimContact` (reuses the existing contact address
  already hardcoded in the privacy/terms pages).
- `components/feed/FeedCard.tsx` + `app/page.tsx` — extended the creator
  query with `is_placeholder`; badge only (no links — the whole card is
  already a `<Link>`, so a nested link isn't valid HTML).
- `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` — extended the query with `source_url` and
  `creator.is_placeholder`; full treatment (badge + "view original post"
  link, shown only when `source_url` is present + claim-contact text).
- `app/tracks/[id]/page.tsx` — extended the query with
  `creator.is_placeholder`; badge only, same reasoning as `FeedCard`.
- `app/systems/[id]/page.tsx` — added an `owner:users!owner_id(is_placeholder)`
  join (this page previously showed no owner information at all) and a
  conditional badge + claim-contact line — no "view original post" link,
  since systems have no `source_url` of their own.
- `e2e/helpers/admin.ts` — `seedSystem`/`seedTrack`/`seedTest` gained
  optional owner/creator-id (and `seedTest` a `source_url`) parameters,
  defaulting to the existing real-test-user behavior; new
  `seedPlaceholderOwnedTest` helper exercises the real
  `create-placeholder-author.ts` to seed a placeholder-owned fixture.
- `e2e/global-teardown.ts` — extended with a second sweep matching
  `[E2E]`-prefixed content by `is_placeholder` ownership, since the
  original sweep only matched the one specific real test-user id and
  would otherwise miss placeholder-owned fixtures entirely.
- `e2e/tests/import-provenance.spec.ts` (new).
- `__claude_context__/components.md` — the new Badge variant and the
  conditional-provenance pattern, including why compact rows get badge-only.
- `__claude_context__/audiophile-compare-schema.md` — `tests.source_url`
  column; `ingest_test` section updated; corrected a stale "not yet
  implemented" cross-reference for the claim flow to point at step 39.
- `__claude_context__/api-conventions.md` §5 — noted `IngestPayload.
  source_url`.
- `__claude_context__/testing.md` — new unit-test row and count, new E2E
  spec row, and a note on placeholder-owned fixtures needing the second
  teardown sweep.
- `__claude_context__/core.md` — build status line.

**Verified:**
- `npm run test` — 27 files / 292 tests, all passing (1 new case in
  `ingest-test-payload.test.ts`). `npx tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (same
  pre-existing, unrelated `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` failures as every
  prior step).
- **EXECUTE lockdown re-confirmed directly against staging with the anon
  key after the `create or replace`:** `POST .../rest/v1/rpc/ingest_test`
  → `401`, `"permission denied for function ingest_test"` — the
  lockdown survives a function replacement, as expected, but worth
  re-checking rather than assuming.
- **`npm run test:integration` — 5/5 passing against staging**, including
  the new assertion that a payload's `source_url` round-trips onto the
  created `tests` row.
- **Full Playwright suite run locally (48/48 passing)**, not just the 5
  new `import-provenance.spec.ts` cases — confirms no regression in any
  existing spec from the query/schema changes. Caught and fixed one real
  bug during this run: the first version of the feed/track-row assertions
  built a `RegExp` directly from a fixture title containing literal
  `[E2E]` brackets, which are regex metacharacters — silently matched
  nothing rather than erroring. Fixed by scoping via `page.locator('li',
  { hasText })` (plain substring matching) instead of a role-name regex.

### ✅ 33 — Forum ingestion: scraper

Standalone script — fetch the Lejonklou thread, walk its pagination, parse
each post's author/timestamp/body (converted to markdown, not raw HTML)/
quoted-post reference/links deterministically (no LLM here), enriched with
oEmbed title/author lookups for YouTube/Vimeo links to aid track
identification downstream. Writes a raw-posts JSON artifact consumed by
step 35; doesn't call the ingest route or need any credentials. Verified
directly against the real live forum, not just fixtures — this caught and
fixed a real bug (special-role usernames render as `a.username-coloured`,
silently dropping the forum's own admin/owner as an author) and corrected
an over-confident early claim about `quoted_post_url` (null only for the
thread's 2016-era posts; the forum was evidently upgraded at some point,
and 35% of a 978-post sample from its recent history resolve a real one).
Full plan: `build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 34 — Google Drive clip provider support

**The gap this closes:** real sampling for step 35 (extraction)'s design
found that Google Drive, Google Photos, and iCloud shared links now
dominate real clip-sharing in the forum (74 + 52 + 17 links vs. 3 YouTube,
in a 978-post recent sample) — none recognized by `detectProvider()`, all
falling into `unknown` (bare-link fallback, no embedded playback). This
isn't ingestion-specific — it affects any user pasting a Drive link into a
test they create live, not just imported content — so it's its own step,
not folded into extraction.

**Decisions:**

1. **Add Google Drive as a first-class provider; leave Google Photos and
   iCloud as `unknown`, by design, not as a remaining gap.** Drive share
   links have a stable, well-known embeddable form
   (`drive.google.com/file/d/{id}/preview`) — confirmed directly (fetched
   a real sampled link's preview URL: `200`, no `X-Frame-Options` or
   `frame-ancestors` CSP directive blocking embedding, real video title in
   the response). Google Photos and iCloud shared albums have no
   equivalent public, stable, embeddable URL designed for third-party use
   — both are consumer gallery viewers that can change format without
   notice. Screen-scraping a fake embed out of either would be fragile
   (breaks silently whenever Google/Apple tweak markup) and isn't worth
   building; their existing `unknown`-provider bare-link treatment (steps
   27/28) is the correct, honest answer given the platforms don't offer
   anything better — not a workaround to eventually fix.

2. **No health verification for Drive, matching the existing YouTube/Vimeo
   precedent exactly.** Neither YouTube nor Vimeo links are health-checked
   today — `detectProvider` returns immediately with no reachability
   check; only `provider = 'direct'` gets the cron's HEAD-request
   verification. A dead embed just shows the provider's own "video
   unavailable" state inside the iframe, an already-established,
   acceptable UX. Drive gets the identical treatment — no Drive API key,
   no Google Cloud project, no custom verification logic.

3. **Real, load-bearing constraint: Drive's `/preview` iframe has no
   public JS SDK for programmatic control — no play-event detection, no
   `pause()` capability.** Unlike YouTube (IFrame API) and Vimeo
   (Player.js), Google doesn't publish an embed-control API for Drive.
   This means a Drive clip cannot participate in `ABPlayer`'s "pause the
   sibling clip when one starts playing" coordination — playing a Drive
   clip won't auto-pause a concurrently-playing YouTube/Vimeo/native
   sibling, and vice versa. `GoogleDrivePlayer` still forwards a
   `PlayerHandle` ref (for type consistency with every other player, per
   `components.md` §5's "all player components use forwardRef" rule) but
   its `pause()` is a documented no-op — the same graceful-no-op behavior
   `UnknownPlayer` already exercises today when a sibling tries to pause
   it. This is an honest, real limitation, not hidden behind a
   pretend-working implementation.

4. **`clips.provider` CHECK constraint needs a migration** —
   `('youtube', 'vimeo', 'direct', 'unknown')` → adding `'google-drive'`.
   Every hardcoded provider union type in the codebase needs the same
   addition (`lib/clips/detect-provider.ts`, `components/media/
   MediaPlayer.tsx`, `app/api/tests/route.ts`, `lib/types/
   test-creation.ts`, `e2e/helpers/admin.ts`) — no single shared type
   alias exists today, so this is repeated by hand at each site, matching
   how the existing four values are already handled.

5. **`POST /api/clips/verify` and `lib/clips/is-unsupported.ts` need zero
   changes.** The verify route already has a generic "trust the URL
   pattern, `url_status: 'ok'`" branch for anything that isn't `direct`
   — Drive falls into it automatically once `detectProvider` recognizes
   it. `isUnsupportedClip` only checks for `provider === 'unknown'` or
   `(direct, media_type unknown)` — Drive is neither, so it's
   automatically treated as supported without touching that file.

**Files updated:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260707191616_clips_google_drive_provider.sql`
  (new) — drops and recreates `clips_provider_check` to allow
  `'google-drive'`. Applied to staging only, not yet production; verified
  directly via the Management API (`pg_get_constraintdef`) that the new
  value is present.
- `lib/clips/detect-provider.ts` — `extractGoogleDriveId` (matches
  `/file/d/{id}`, deliberately not `/drive/folders/...`), a new
  `google-drive` branch returning `media_type: 'video'` (matching the
  youtube/vimeo precedent, and the one inspected real sample being a
  `.mov` file) and canonical `/file/d/{id}/preview` URL.
- `lib/clips/__tests__/detect-provider.test.ts` — 3 new cases (standard
  share URL, already-embedded preview URL, folder link not misdetected).
- `lib/clips/__tests__/to-clip-data.test.ts` — 1 new case confirming
  `embed_id`/`canonical_url` derivation for the new provider.
- `components/media/players/GoogleDrivePlayer.tsx` (new) — iframe embed,
  `forwardRef` + `useImperativeHandle` per the established pattern,
  documented no-op `pause()`.
- `components/media/MediaPlayer.tsx` — new provider branch; `ClipData`
  provider union extended.
- `components/media/__tests__/ABPlayer.test.tsx` — 1 new case: a Drive
  clip renders the correct iframe `src`, and rendering alongside a sibling
  doesn't throw.
- `app/api/tests/route.ts`, `lib/types/test-creation.ts`,
  `e2e/helpers/admin.ts` — provider union types extended (no single
  shared type alias exists for this union today, so each site is updated
  by hand, matching how the original four values are already handled).
- `__claude_context__/components.md` §5 — `ClipData` canonical definition,
  the new player, and its documented no-pause limitation.
- `__claude_context__/audiophile-compare-schema.md` — `clips_provider_check`
  updated; new "Google Drive clip provider (step 34)" section.
- `__claude_context__/testing.md` — updated test counts and rows.
- `__claude_context__/build-history-ingestion.md` — step 35 (extraction)
  decision 12's clip-health caveat updated: Drive is resolved, Photos/
  iCloud remain open by design, not as a gap.
- `__claude_context__/core.md` — build status line.

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** `detect-provider.test.ts` (3 new), `to-clip-data.test.ts` (1
  new) — Drive URL recognized, file ID extracted, canonical `/preview`
  URL constructed; a Drive *folder* link isn't misdetected as a file.
- **Component:** `ABPlayer.test.tsx` (1 new) — a Drive clip renders an
  iframe with the correct `src`, and rendering it alongside a sibling
  clip doesn't throw (the no-op-pause path).
- **E2E:** none — no new user-facing flow, just a new embed type an
  existing flow can now render.

**Verified:**
- `npm run test` — 29 files / 314 tests, all passing (6 new). `npx tsc
  --noEmit` — no new errors (same pre-existing, unrelated
  `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` failures as every prior step).
- **Confirmed the core technical assumption directly against a real
  sampled Drive link before writing any code**: fetched
  `drive.google.com/file/d/{id}/preview` — `200`, no `X-Frame-Options` or
  `frame-ancestors` CSP directive, real video title in the response
  (`"A.mov - Google Drive"`) — the embed genuinely works, not assumed.
- Migration applied to staging; `clips_provider_check`'s new definition
  confirmed directly via the Management API.

### ✅ 35 — Forum ingestion: extraction

Takes step 33's raw posts and does the hard semantic work — per-author
system/snapshot continuity (simplified to one placeholder system per
creator), clip-health filtering (reusing existing verify logic), technique
hardcoded to 'Tune Method' (the forum's stated convention), and a flagged
placeholder for tracks that can't be identified from text or clip
metadata. Reply-to-test attribution (matching a voter's reply against a
different author's open candidate) was the highest-risk open design
question; resolved architecturally as a single chronological walk over
the whole thread backed by one shared cross-author candidate index, with
a reveal closing a candidate to further matching and a 21-day
auto-expiry. Uses the Vercel AI SDK (`generateObject` + Zod, via the AI
Gateway) rather than calling ingest directly — output is a local,
human-editable candidate repository (one JSON file per candidate,
organized into `pending`/`needs_review`/`ready`/`approved`/
`ingested/staging`/`ingested/production`/`expired` subfolders — the
folder a file sits in *is* its status), never a live API call. Built,
unit-tested (34 files / 386 tests passing), and trial-run twice against
real data (a 40-page sample) — found and fixed two real bugs this way
(a label-collision bug across multi-pair posts, and the model echoing a
composite label back as a match target) and documented one accepted gap
(`ambiguous_attribution` is defined but never actually triggers). Full
plan: `build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 36 — Forum ingestion: commit

Separate, simple script, parameterized by target environment — reads
`approved/` for staging or `ingested/staging/` for production (never the
other way around, enforcing "staging first" at the tooling level) and
POSTs each candidate to `/api/internal/ingest`, moving successes into that
environment's `ingested/` folder. The only step that touches a deployed
environment; no LLM, no judgment calls. Also where two real bugs were
found and fixed by reviewing the first real commit on staging (test
reveal status never set regardless of vote count; `created_at` always
defaulted to ingestion time) — see `build-history-ingestion.md` step 36
findings 8–9 for the full account, including a real process mistake
(editing an already-applied migration file, which silently no-ops on
`supabase db push`) worth reading for the general lesson. Full plan and
verification: `build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 37 — Forum ingestion: run the import, staging then production

The actual one-time deliverable — scrape, extract into candidates, review
and approve them, commit for real against `audiophile-staging`, manually
verify in the app, then commit the same, staging-verified set against
`audiophile-prod`. No new code; exercised steps 30–36. Confirmed for real,
independently of the user's own report — 44 usable tests now live on
production (`curl`'d the real production feed page directly and read the
rendered content, not just the local candidate-repo folder counts):
correct historical dates, varied Revealed/Blind status, real vote counts,
and step 40's system-name-prefixed titles/snapshot lines all rendering
correctly. The other 164 real candidates extracted from the thread ended
up in `broken/` (dead/missing/unplayable clip links) — see
`build-history-ingestion.md` step 35's clip-health work. Full plan and
verification: `build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 38 — Data erasure requests (votes / content / full account)

Rescoped from an original "undo a bad production import" safety-net plan
(superseded — its ownership-check design had a real gap: it never
considered that a test's voters are separately claimable identities from
the test's own creator) to what the real need turned out to be: admin-
triggered, human-verified deletion for three support scenarios — an
unmerged placeholder's votes only, an unmerged placeholder's tests and
systems, or a registered user's full data including the account itself
(votes, systems, snapshots, tests, then `auth.users`/`public.users`).
Three reusable `security definer` Postgres functions
(`erase_user_votes`/`erase_user_content`/`erase_user_account`), atomic by
construction — deliberately learning from a real gap found in
`rollback.ts` (see below), which does the equivalent deletion as 4
separate non-transactional calls. `erase_user_account` needed a real
schema fix first: `tracks.created_by` was `not null` with no cascade,
which would have blocked deleting `public.users` the moment the erased
user had ever created a track — now nullable, nulled rather than
blocking (tracks are shared, `created_by` is provenance only). Admin
route + minimal form built (`app/api/admin/erase-user-data/`,
`app/admin/erase-user-data/`). Migration applied to staging (production
not yet — separate, deliberate step per this project's "staging first"
convention); 14/14 integration tests passing for real, including EXECUTE
lockdown against an anon key. Admin gate re-verified with a real
authenticated-but-non-admin session (404), not just anonymous requests,
and the real admin account confirmed the form itself presents correctly
at `/admin/erase-user-data` — the one gap the assistant couldn't close
directly (no real admin credentials in this environment) closed by the
user instead. Not the same thing as
`scripts/rollback-lejonklou.ts`/`lib/ingestion/rollback.ts` (built during
step 36, an interim ingestion-pipeline-only tool, unrelated to this step,
left unchanged). Full plan: `build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 39 — Claim flow (merge a placeholder into a real account)

Lets a real Lejonklou forum member claim their imported content. Identity
verification is a forum PM to the site owner's own forum account — no
generated code, no new UI, since the sender's forum identity is itself the
proof; proportionate to an estimated dozen or so total claims. Admin-
triggered (reuses the same `isAdminEmail` gate as `/version` and step 38's
erasure routes), not self-service, and no new claim-request state
machine. The merge itself is `claim_placeholder`, a `security definer`
Postgres function mirroring step 38's `erase_user_*` functions' shape —
same EXECUTE lockdown, same atomicity — that reassigns all five content
FK columns (`systems.owner_id`, `tests.creator_id`, `tracks.created_by`,
`comments.user_id`, `votes.user_id`), repoints (not deletes)
`import_authors`, deletes the placeholder's `public.users` row, and drops
a colliding vote in favor of the real user's own existing one. Admin
route/page/form (`app/api/admin/claim/`, `app/admin/claim/`) built with a
preview-before-merge step, matching step 38's own UX pattern. Migration
applied to and independently re-verified on both `audiophile-staging` and
`audiophile-prod` (`supabase migration list` checked directly against
both); 17/17 integration tests passing for real (3 for
`claim_placeholder`), unit suite and typecheck unaffected, admin gate
curl-verified for real (401/404). Full plan and verification:
`build-history-ingestion.md`.

### ✅ 40 — Surface system/snapshot info consistently: test detail page + ingested test titles

## Part A — Show system/snapshot info on the test detail page

**The gap this closes:** the public feed (`components/feed/FeedCard.tsx`)
already shows a neutral "`SystemName · label`  vs  `SystemName · label`"
line for every test, blind or revealed — but the test detail page
(`app/tests/[id]/page.tsx`) never fetches or renders this at all. Not a
regression: confirmed via `git log` that `MappingBadge.tsx` (the
component that shows the revealed Before/After badge) has looked this way
since the page's original commit, and the detail page's own query has
never selected `snapshot_a`/`snapshot_b`. It simply went unnoticed until
now — a web-created test's own creator already knows their own system,
and no real *imported* test had ever actually reached `status='revealed'`
until the forum-ingestion pipeline's recent reveal-status fix
(`build-history-ingestion.md` step 36 finding 8), so this is the first
time anyone besides a test's own creator has had reason to look at a
revealed test's detail page expecting to see which systems were compared.
Like step 32, this is UI work, not ingestion-pipeline infrastructure, so
it gets its full detail directly here.

**Decisions:**

1. **Match the feed's existing line exactly, not a redesign — extract a
   shared formatter instead of writing the join/format logic a second
   time.** `app/page.tsx`'s query already does
   `snapshot_a:system_snapshots!snapshot_a_id(label, system:systems(name))`
   / same for `snapshot_b`, and `FeedCard.tsx` formats it as
   `` `${system?.name ?? '?'} · ${label}` `` for each side, joined by
   `'  vs  '`, skipping either side if the join comes back null. New
   `lib/tests/format-snapshot-line.ts` exports that formatting function
   once; `FeedCard.tsx` is refactored to call it (pure refactor, no
   behavior change) and `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` calls the same function
   against a newly-extended query. One implementation, two call sites —
   consistent with this repo's own repeated-logic convention.

2. **Shown unconditionally, not gated behind `isRevealed`.** The feed
   already shows this for both open and revealed tests today, since
   naming which two snapshots are being compared doesn't disclose which
   one is "before" vs "after," or which one people preferred — that
   information stays exactly as gated as it already is, behind
   `isRevealed`/`canSeeTally`/`MappingBadge`. The detail page's version
   must match that, not introduce a new gate the feed doesn't have.

3. **Position: directly under the track line in the header**, the same
   relative location `FeedCard` already puts it (title → track → snapshot
   line → byline), so a viewer sees consistent information in a
   consistent place whether they're looking at the feed or a test they've
   clicked into.

4. **Deliberately out of scope: `MappingBadge` itself still only shows
   generic "Before"/"After," not the actual snapshot/system name next to
   each.** E.g. "Before: Living room rig · v1 baseline" instead of just
   "Before" is a reasonable, related enhancement, but it's a separate
   design decision — it changes what a *revealed* view specifically
   discloses (right now, deliberately, just before/after identity), not
   just adds already-public information that's missing elsewhere. Noted
   as a follow-on option, not built as part of closing this gap.

**Files updated:**
- `lib/tests/format-snapshot-line.ts` (new) — `formatSnapshotLine(snapshotA,
  snapshotB)`, typed against a shared `SnapshotSummary = { label: string;
  system: { name: string } | null } | null`, extracted verbatim from
  `FeedCard.tsx`'s existing inline logic.
- `lib/tests/__tests__/format-snapshot-line.test.ts` (new) — both
  snapshots present; one or both null (test still has *a* track/clips but
  a malformed/partial snapshot join, matching `FeedCard`'s existing
  defensive handling); a system join that resolves to `null` falls back
  to `'?'`, same as today.
- `components/feed/FeedCard.tsx` — replace the inline `snapshotLine`
  construction with a call to the new shared helper. No behavior change;
  existing `FeedCard`-related tests/specs must keep passing unmodified.
- `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx` — extend the existing `.select(...)` with
  `snapshot_a:system_snapshots!snapshot_a_id(label, system:systems(name))`
  / `snapshot_b:...!snapshot_b_id(...)`; normalize the joined relation the
  same way `track`/`creator` already are (Supabase returns a singular FK
  join as either an object or a one-element array depending on PostgREST
  version); render `formatSnapshotLine(...)` in the header, unconditionally
  (decision 2).
- `__claude_context__/components.md` — document the new shared helper and
  its two call sites.
- `__claude_context__/testing.md` — new unit-test row/count; new E2E
  assertion noted against whichever spec decision below picks.

**Tests:**
- **Unit:** `format-snapshot-line.test.ts` per above. `FeedCard.tsx` has
  no dedicated unit test file today (confirmed — it's a server component,
  covered only by E2E, same convention as `app/tests/[id]/page.tsx`
  itself), so the refactor's correctness there is verified by the E2E
  assertion below, not a new unit test.
- **E2E:** extend `e2e/tests/voting.spec.ts` (already navigates to a
  seeded test's detail page via `seedCompleteTest`, which produces
  distinct, assertable fixture data — `System A {suffix}`/`Snapshot A
  {suffix}` and `System B {suffix}`/`Snapshot B {suffix}`) with an
  assertion that the detail page shows both system/snapshot names,
  visible before any reveal action — proving decision 2's "unconditional,
  not reveal-gated" requirement for real, not just by code inspection.

## Part B — Concatenate system name into ingested test titles

**The gap this closes:** an ingested test's title is currently just
`"<artist> – <title>"` (`resolveTestTitle`'s fallback,
`lib/ingestion/ingest-test-payload.ts:118-119`) — the *only* thing that
distinguishes two different comparisons of the same track (a real,
common case in this dataset — the same track gets re-compared across many
different system changes over months) is a hover or a click, since the
list/feed view shows nothing else prominent enough to tell them apart at
a glance. Prepending the system name makes each entry uniquely
identifiable without opening it.

**Confirmed scope — this only ever affects ingested tests, nothing else:**
`resolveTestTitle` has exactly one caller,
`app/api/internal/ingest/route.ts:94` — the web creation wizard's own
route (`app/api/tests/route.ts`) requires `title` as a mandatory field
directly from the form and never calls `resolveTestTitle` at all, so a
web-created test is entirely unaffected by this change; it never reaches
the fallback branch this step modifies.

**Decisions:**

1. **New format: `"<system name> · <artist> – <title>"`**, e.g.
   `"Charlie1's system · Diana Krall – The Look of Love"` — reusing the
   `·` separator this codebase already uses for the same "system name
   joined with something else" purpose (`FeedCard`'s own snapshot line,
   Part A above) rather than inventing a new one, and keeping the
   existing `–` between artist and title unchanged.
2. **Deduplicate when `snapshot_a`/`snapshot_b` share one system name
   (the real, expected case for every actual forum-ingested test —
   `extract-post.ts` always sets both snapshots' `system_name` to the
   same `"<forum author>'s system"` string) — join both names when they
   genuinely differ instead of arbitrarily picking one.** A test
   comparing snapshots from two distinctly-named systems is technically
   possible under this schema even though extraction never currently
   produces one; `resolveTestTitle` shouldn't silently drop information
   in that case. Format when different: `"<system A> / <system B> ·
   <artist> – <title>"`.
3. **An explicit `payload.title` still always wins, unchanged.** This
   only touches the fallback branch — a caller that already supplies a
   real title (none does today, but the field stays optional/available)
   is untouched.
4. **Deliberately not deduplicated against the track subtitle already
   shown separately underneath the title on the detail page** (`app/
   tests/[id]/page.tsx`'s existing `{track?.artist} — {track?.title}`
   line, Part A's new snapshot line, and now a title that also contains
   the track name) — some repetition between the H1 and its own subtitle
   is an accepted, minor cosmetic cost of making the *feed/list* view (the
   actual place this change matters — the detail page already disambiguates
   fully once opened) usefully distinct at a glance.

**Files updated:**
- `lib/ingestion/ingest-test-payload.ts` — `resolveTestTitle` rewritten
  per decisions 1-3.
- `lib/ingestion/__tests__/ingest-test-payload.test.ts` — existing
  `describe('resolveTestTitle', ...)` cases updated: the two
  fallback-path tests currently expect `"${ARTIST} – ${TRACK_TITLE}"`,
  but `validPayload()`'s fixture already gives `snapshot_a`/`snapshot_b`
  the same `SYSTEM_NAME`, so both need their expected value updated to
  `"${SYSTEM_NAME} · ${ARTIST} – ${TRACK_TITLE}"` once this ships (not a
  new bug — the fixture already matches real ingested-data shape, the
  expectation just needs to catch up to the new behavior). New case:
  `snapshot_a`/`snapshot_b` given genuinely different system names →
  both joined with `/`. Explicit-title case is unaffected, no change
  needed there.
- `app/api/internal/ingest/__tests__/route.integration.test.ts` — the
  fixture's `SYSTEM_NAME` is already shared between `snapshot_a`/
  `snapshot_b` (see its `payload()` helper), so the existing
  "creates a test" assertion's expectations may need a corresponding
  title check added, confirming the real route produces the new format
  against real staging, not just the unit-level fallback logic.
- `__claude_context__/api-conventions.md` §5 — checked: the forum-
  ingestion section doesn't currently mention `resolveTestTitle` or title
  resolution at all, so nothing to update there, only confirmed by
  reading it rather than assumed.
- `__claude_context__/testing.md` — updated test descriptions/counts for
  both files touched above.

**Tests:** covered inline in "Files updated" above — no new test files,
existing ones extended.

**Verified:** `npm run test` — 38 files / 440 tests, all passing (6 new:
5 in the new `lib/tests/__tests__/format-snapshot-line.test.ts`, 1 more in
`ingest-test-payload.test.ts` for the differing-system-names case, plus
2 existing `resolveTestTitle` fallback tests updated for the new format).
`npx tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (same pre-existing, unrelated
`__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts` failures as every prior step). `npm run
test:integration` — 9/9 passing against real staging, including the new
title-format assertion. `npx playwright test e2e/tests/voting.spec.ts` —
run twice: first against the deployed staging site
(`E2E_BASE_URL=https://staging.audiophile-compare.uk`), where the new
snapshot-line assertion correctly failed — staging is still running the
previously-deployed `page.tsx`, without Part A's query/render changes,
same reason steps 23/26/27 ran e2e locally instead. Re-run against a
local dev server (`E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`, pointed at the
same staging Supabase project via the ambient `.env.local` credentials)
— all 4 tests passed, confirming Part A's actual rendering is correct;
the first run's failure was a deployment-staleness artifact, not a code
bug, verified by comparing the two runs directly rather than assumed.

### ✅ 41 — Surface admin page links on the profile page

**The gap this closes:** two admin-only pages exist —
`/admin/erase-user-data` (step 38) and `/admin/claim` (step 39) — both
gated server-side by `isAdminEmail(user.email)`, but neither was linked
from anywhere in the app; an admin had to type the URL by hand.
`SiteHeader.tsx` renders the same nav to every signed-in user regardless
of admin status — there was no admin-only nav surface anywhere.

**Decisions:**

1. **Where the check happens.** Inline in `app/profile/page.tsx`, calling
   `isAdminEmail(user.email)` on the `user` the page already fetches for
   its own redirect check — the same pattern every other call site
   (`/version`, `/admin/erase-user-data`, `/admin/claim`) already uses,
   with no shared wrapper. One more call site didn't justify extracting
   one.
2. **Placement and markup.** A new section at the end of the page, after
   "Change password", separated by the same `<hr>` the other sections
   use. The section heading uses `<Heading level={2}>` — the correct,
   current component per `components.md`'s "one h2 per page section"
   rule — rather than copying the page's own pre-existing hand-rolled
   `<h2 className="text-sm font-semibold">` on the "Change email"
   section (that hand-rolled instance predates/bypasses step 22's
   `Heading` extraction; left as-is, not fixed here, but not perpetuated
   in new code either). Inside the section, two stacked
   `Link variant="inline"` entries, not `variant="card"` (reserved for
   list-of-entities rows like feed/track/system cards — two static
   admin links aren't a list of entities).
3. **Link labels reuse existing strings, not new copies.**
   `messages/en.json` already has `admin.eraseUserData.heading` and
   `admin.claim.heading` — the exact page titles for those two routes.
   The profile page pulls both via two extra `getTranslations()` calls
   and uses them directly as link text, so the labels can never drift
   from what those pages call themselves. Only one new string was
   needed: `profile.adminHeading` ("Admin").
4. **Order:** erase-user-data link first, then claim — matches
   `api-conventions.md` Rule 8's caller list order and the `app/admin/`
   directory listing order.
5. **Testing proportionality — matches steps 38/39's own admin pages,
   not full E2E coverage for a two-link section.** No unit test (the
   page is an async server component with no client-side logic, same
   established convention as every other server page). E2E covers the
   negative case only — confirmed `E2E_TEST_USER_EMAIL` is not in
   `ADMIN_EMAILS` in this environment, so one new assertion in the
   existing `profile.spec.ts` (the Admin section is absent for a normal
   authenticated user) is a real regression guard at zero new fixture
   cost. The positive case (an admin actually sees the links) isn't
   automated — a dedicated admin-only Playwright fixture (its own
   `ADMIN_EMAILS`-listed account, its own storageState, a second
   project) would be disproportionate for two static links; verified
   manually instead, the same way steps 38/39's own admin pages were.

**Files updated:**
- `app/profile/page.tsx` — `isAdminEmail` check, two `getTranslations()`
  calls (`admin.eraseUserData`, `admin.claim`), the new conditional
  section.
- `messages/en.json` — `profile.adminHeading`.
- `e2e/tests/profile.spec.ts` — new assertion: non-admin doesn't see the
  Admin section.
- `__claude_context__/testing.md` §6 — `profile.spec.ts` coverage row
  updated.
- `__claude_context__/components.md` — a short note under the
  `Heading`/`Link` usage docs pointing at this page as a real example of
  `Heading level={2}` + stacked `Link variant="inline"` for a short,
  non-entity link list.
- `__claude_context__/core.md` §6 — new ✅ 41 entry.
- `__claude_context__/build-history.md` (this file) — this entry, plus a
  correction to the previously-stale step 39 stub above (it still said
  "planned, not yet built" from before step 39 was actually built and
  verified in a later session; full detail always lived in
  `build-history-ingestion.md`, only this file's short summary was out
  of date).

**Tests:** covered inline above — one new E2E assertion, no new files.

**Verified:** `npm run test` — 38 files / 440 tests, all passing, no
change (no unit tests added, matching the plan). `npx tsc --noEmit` — no
new errors (same pre-existing, unrelated `__tests__/supabase-*.test.ts`
failures as every prior step). `npx playwright test
e2e/tests/profile.spec.ts` — run against a local dev server, all 4 tests
passing including the new non-admin assertion. Merged to `Dev`,
`Staging`, and `main` (`6cb757c`); the real admin account confirmed the
positive case — both links visible and working on `/profile` — on all
deployments, the one gap the assistant couldn't close directly (no real
admin credentials in this environment), same as steps 38/39.

Deferred features (agentic ingestion pipeline, owned blob storage, mobile app) are documented in `deferred-features.md`. Steps 30, 31, 33, and 35–39 above have their full detailed plan in `build-history-ingestion.md`; steps 32, 34, 40, and 41 (UI/core-app work, not pipeline infrastructure) are fully detailed here instead — see that file's frontmatter for why.
